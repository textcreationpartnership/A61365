            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But for what is paſt, we have made ſome remarks upon thoſe viciſſitudes, and changes, which we, and our Anceſtors have ſeen in this Kingdom. And particularly noting the different ſtate, and poſture of the ſame, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the alteration, and change muſt needs have been very great, as to the moſt important concerns of the Nation, ſince the Power, and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> was here exauctorated. Upon which, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, we wiſhed ſome particular account of the State, and habit of our Body Politick, when the Influences from <hi>Rome</hi> were praedominant over it: and that, as well in reference to our Head, the King's Majeſty, as alſo to the Members, the People: wherein we deſired ſeriouſly to know, whether the
<pb facs="tcp:49655:3"/>Pope's Power was prejudicial to them, or either of them.</p>
            <p>In which matter, that I might give ſome ſatisfaction to you, and my ſelf alſo, I ſet my ſelf to methodize ſuch notes, and inſtances, as formerly had occurred to me: Firſt, Touching the Property of the People, and how that was invaded by the Romiſh Practices: And then, touching the Supremacy of the Royal Majeſty of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and how that was Eclipſed by the interpoſition of the Papal Power: And now I have put theſe Collections together, you ſee what they amount unto.</p>
            <p>I confeſs the Subjects are tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and vaſt; and not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with my line. The trivial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies amongſt Neighbours, about <hi>Meum,</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> frequently puzzle the graveſt Judges, but for the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>Arcana imperii,</hi> he that ſhall endeavour to poiſe them, ſhall ſooner diſcover the weakneſs of his own Arm, than their weight: I have known the united ſtrenghts of Parliaments put to puffing, and blowing, when they have lifted at them. But, as the
<pb facs="tcp:49655:4"/>Divines ſay of the Holy Scriptures, though they contain many Myſteries, and things hard to be underſtood; yet there is plainly, and clearly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in them ſo much as is ſufficient to make men good Chriſtians: So, in the Doctrine of the King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, though we cannot reach its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt import, there is yet ſo much of it clearly diſcoverable, as is ſufficient to make all Engliſhmen good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: And as to that, I have entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Diſcourſe an <hi>Eſſay</hi> only, not pretending to ſay all that the ſubject affords; and have travelled no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein, than our Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Authorities, and Records have lead me: and I hope that thereby I have produced Demonſtration ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that our Soveraign is inveſted with a moſt juſt Authority over all his Subjects, and in all Cauſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Dominions: and then ſeeing that <hi>Veritas eſt index ſui, &amp; obliqui,</hi> it follows, by all the rules of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that the Pope's Uſurpations were moſt unjuſt.</p>
            <p>For that other concern relating to the People's Property, I took that
<pb facs="tcp:49655:4"/>task, at firſt, to have been much the eaſier of the two; that is, that it would not have been very hard, to have comprehended, and given ſome reaſonable eſtimate of thoſe ſumms which heretofore went out of <hi>England</hi> to the Popes, and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But after a little dealing therein, I ſtrangely found the account to ſwell beyond all bounds, and ſoon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the difficulty to lye as much in the mutiplicity in this, as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſs in the other. This Grievance was, and could be, adequately known only to our Anceſtors who felt it, but the ſmart is not as yet quite worn off of their Poſterity; and therefore what is offered in this affair, I have thought fit to ſtile, a <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and indeed it ought not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, I may poſſibly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſound Paradox; That though it is conceiv'd a very hard thing now to underſtand, as formerly it was to endure, and once thought more hard to remedy, all the miſchiefs which our Fore-fathers ſuffered from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Uſurpation, and Tyranny; yet
<pb facs="tcp:49655:5"/>certainly the Cure was at all times not ſo very difficult to have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: the Antidote was as near as the Poyſon; and there never wanted a Panpharmacon, which, if duly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, would at any time have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved thoſe malignant diſtempers that invaded the Kingdom's conſtitution: And that was, in a word, the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the good Laws. It is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Excellency of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> that no man can have a wrong, or damage, but the Law, if rightly managed, will do him right. Did the Papal Power uſurp, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Did the Romiſh Practices weaken, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh the People? the ſame Law at once arraigned, and damned thoſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and grievances; and hence it was that all the ſupervenient Statutes ran but as Declaratory of the old Law.

            <p>What thoughts theſe Collections, and Obſervations will raiſe in you, or others, I can but gueſs at: I am ſure they have ſufficiently diſcover'd to me the drift of the Papal Policy; That is, to eſtabliſh, and uphold a Spiritual Dominion in the World: to effect which, it was neceſſary the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men ſhould firſt be inſlaved by ſuperſtition, and ignorance; and then, by the Uſurpation of Temporal Power, and the ingroſſing of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Riches, the work was done; and the Papal intereſt ſo carryed all in the middle, and dark Times, when Kings durſt not exerciſe their juſt authority,
<pb facs="tcp:49655:6"/>nor the People call that which they had their own: and in this deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it was, that the Laws were muffled up. But when, towards the latter Ages, the revolution came of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Knowledge, with a reviviſcence and improvement of all Arts, and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and men became tyred with groping ſo long in the dark, and thoſe great Lights began to dawn in the World, then both Kings, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rouzed up themſelves, and their Spirits revived, the ſhades vaniſhed, the Birds of darkneſs flew away, and the Beaſts of prey retired to their dens: Every man then, with alacrity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to his proper Office; Princes took their Scepters in their hands, and ſwayed them again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul; the People applyed themſelves all to their honeſt callings, and what they got by God's bleſſing, and their own induſtry, they injoyed whileſt they liv'd, and when they dyed left it to their poſterity; which formerly uſed to be ſnatch'd away before their faces by the Romiſh Harpyes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49655:7"/>
            <p>The conſideration of all which, as it clearly manifeſts the great abuſes, poverty, and ſlavery, which this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion once, and for a long time ſuffered under the Pope's yoke; ſo it cannot but make us reflect on that proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable miſchief which ſtill lyes upon thoſe that have not yet ſhak'd him off: with this further obſervation, how an entire ſubjection unto Popery corrupts, and debaſes the ſpirits of men; for nothing is more obvious, than that in <hi>Italy, Spain, Flanders,</hi> and other Countreys wholly the Popes, as to his ſpiritual raign, the Inhabitants are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moſt Atheiſtical, debauched, and diſſolute; or thoſe, who with a blind zeal apply themſelves to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the Rites of that confuſed, and abſurd Religion, preſently become fond, and ſtupid, giving themſelves up only to admire their Holy Father the Pope, their Confeſſors, and Prieſts, fancying <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true model of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Pope, and his Cardinals ruling therein like Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; gazing upon the formality, and gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Church, and intangled
<pb facs="tcp:49655:7"/>with a multitude of ridiculous Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Obſervances: all which tends to make them unactive, and unfit for all thoſe generous, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious courſes that bring Honour, and Riches to a People: When, on the contrary, the Reformed part of the World, being manumitted from ſuch ſlavery, and incumbrances, beat out the Popiſh every where in Trading, and generally excell them in all Arts, and Sciences. And this may be noted in our ſelves, when preſently after the Reformation, the Engliſh grew potent at Sea, ſent forth great Colonies and Plantations; maintained traffick, and commerce over the World, and brought home Honour, Plenty, and Riches to the Nation. So the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders,</hi> after they had freed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Romiſh briers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently got good fleeces on their backs, grew rich, and powerful, eclipſing the glory of <hi>Venice,</hi> that once famous Republick, which hath ever ſince been in the wane: <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſupplanted <hi>Antwerp: Flanders</hi> truckled under <hi>Holland:</hi> and the Hanſe Towns ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Proteſtant, outſtrip'd all their
<pb facs="tcp:49655:8"/>Popiſh Neighbours in wealth, and ſtrength. Whileſt the once great, and dreadful Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> is fallen into a Conſumption, ſupported only with a little Indian Gold, which they ſteal home ſometimes. The Auſtrian Eagle hath molted his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Portugal</hi> loſing both in their Plantations abroad, and reputation at home. And in thoſe Countreys where Proteſtants and Papiſts are mingled, as in <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance, Germany, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. the Proteſtants generally are the Traders, and grow rich, as all Travellers teſtifie.</p>
            <p>For, beſides that an addicted zeal to the Romiſh Religion contracts, and debaſeth the ſpirits of men; their Guides endeavour alſo, by all poſſible means, to contain them in a dull, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and formal way; knowing Learning, and knowledge to be their common Enemy, as at once diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and overthrowing all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures reared upon their ſandy foundation. But then, what Wealth, what Honour, and Riches do their Clergy, and Orders enjoy? How glorious the Popes; How ſplendid
<pb facs="tcp:49655:8"/>the Cardinals; How abounding in Riches, and Titles, all their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Kindred, and Dependants? all ſuck'd from the People. Whileſt to lull, and gratifie the abuſed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they have infinite devices: they have perpetual proviſions for the dull ſouls, in their Cells: the auſtere may take their fill of Diſcipline, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour: the impure, and voluptuous, have their conveniences at hand: the lawleſs, who find themſelves too ſtrait lac'd, may be eaſed by Diſpenſations: the credulous ſhall never want Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; the fantaſtical viſions; nor the ſuperſtitious Ceremonies; with infinite baubles more, to keep the uneaſie Babes quiet.</p>
            <p>Now when any perſon comes to claim, or exerciſe any extraordinary power, or authority, in a place, or ſhall levy, and take up what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys he pleaſe, he muſt reaſonably expect to have a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> ſued out againſt him, to which he muſt plead his Title to his Priviledge; and that, I muſt confeſs, hath been very fairly done by the Papal Attorneys in this cauſe, on the behalf of their
<pb facs="tcp:49655:9"/>Holy Client; and they have drawn their Plea from the written Text of the Divine Law, in this manner; <hi>God made two great Lights in the firmament;
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.16.</note> the greater Light to rule the day, and the leſſer Light to rule the night:</hi> from which they inferr the infallible Dominion of the Church; for Pope Innocent the Third wrote to the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> thus:
<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Imp. Decret. lib. 1. de major. &amp; Obed. Tit. 33.</note> 
               <hi>You ought to know</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that God made two great lights in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Heaven, the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night; both great, but the one greater. To the Firmament of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that is, the Catholick Church, God made two great Lights, that is, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted two Powers, the Papal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Regal Dignity; but that which is to rule by day, that is over ſpiritual things, is the greater; but that over carnal things the leſs, that there may be known to be as much difference between Popes, and Kings, as there is to be between the Sun, and Moon.</hi> And then comes the Gloſs upon the Canon Law, which ſayes, <hi>Whileſt the Earth is ſeven times bigger
<pb facs="tcp:49655:9"/>than the Moon; and the Sun Eight times bigger than the Earth: the Papal Power muſt conſequently be fifty ſeven times bigger than the Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, that great Hebrew Prophet ſets forth a moſt exact Image of the Royal Papacy, in <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Campanel. de Mon. Hiſp. cap. 5.</note> who did prefigure, ſay they, the Majeſty of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſours, who had <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> for their Prototype: and therefore the Pope muſt needs be inveſted with a Royal Prieſthood, and armed as well with the Civil, as the ſpiritual Sword; for if it were otherwiſe, Chriſt, and ſo his Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, would be a diminutive Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and not as <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was at once both King, and Prieſt.</p>
            <p>Further, to fortifie this Plea to a Royal Jurſſdiction in the World, they alledge that <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were perfect Types of the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and the <hi>Hereticks;</hi> ſignifying that the <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſhould abound in Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Riches; but the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſhould be low, and poor: expreſſed fully in the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:49655:10"/>of the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,
<note place="margin">Luke 1.33.</note> That our Lord the Pope was to rule over the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>for ever, and of his Kingdom there ſhall be no end.</hi> That is, in a word, <hi>The Pope is to govern the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Argument to prove this Plea is fetch'd out of the Eighth <hi>Pſalm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.5, 6.</note> viz. <hi>Thou haſt Crowned him with glory, and honour. Thou makeſt him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands: thou haſt put all things under his feet. All Sheep, and Oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field. The Fowl of the air,
<note place="margin">Anton. Sum. Theol. p. 3. cap. 5.</note> and the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. By this, they ſay, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the power given to him, and his Succeſſors in the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> to whom God hath ſubjected the <hi>Sheep,</hi> that is, the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> the <hi>Oxen,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Hereticks;</hi> the <hi>Beaſts of the Field,</hi> that is, the <hi>Pagans;</hi> the <hi>Fiſhes of the Sea,</hi> that is, the <hi>Souls in Purgatory;</hi> and the <hi>Fowls of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that is, the <hi>bleſſed Spirits and Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for Dominion, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; now for Wealth, and Riches;
<pb facs="tcp:49655:10"/>nothing is more plain, ſay they, than the Holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the Roman Church, <hi>The Gentiles ſhall come to thy light,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 60.</note> and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing: Then ſhalt thou ſee and wonder, and rejoice when the riches of the Sea, and all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Gentiles ſhall come unto thee: they ſhall bring gold and incenſe. The ſons of Strangers ſhall build up thy Walls, and their Kings ſhall mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter unto thee. Thy Gates ſhall be open day and night, that they may bring unto thee the Riches of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their Kings ſhall be brought: For the Nation and Kingdom that will not ſerve thee ſhall periſh. The ſons of them that afflicted thee ſhall come bending unto thee, and all they that deſpiſed thee ſhall bow down at the ſoles of thy feet. Thou ſhalt ſuck the milk of the Gentiles, and ſhalt ſuck the breaſts of Kings. For Braſs I will bring Gold, and for Iron Silver, and for Wood Braſs, and for Stones Iron.</hi> A moſt plain deſcription of the glory, and ſplendor of the Roman Church: but the dull Hereticks will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning: and St. <hi>John,</hi> they
<pb facs="tcp:49655:11"/>ſay, was ſurpriſed with a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when he deſcribes the Angel refuſing the honour offered to him, but now du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully paid to Chriſts Vicar.</p>
            <p>Then, when Chriſt told St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that he would make him a <hi>Fiſher of men,</hi> though poſſibly the innocent, and meek Apoſtle, not fully apprehending the full import of that right which thereby was conferred on him, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to a kind of ſpiritual Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hunting after ſome myſtical Fiſhes, to incloſe them in the net of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Kingdom in the Heavens; and Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> interprets the donation thus,
<note place="margin">Regin. Pole in Ioc.</note> 
               <hi>Thou and thy Succeſſors ſhall have dominion over all men, ruling over Kings, and commanding, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, and caſting out Emperours:</hi> yet the good Apoſtle's more illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſucceſſors, have now hit upon the true import, and meaning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Chriſt did not only give them a power to fiſh for men, but for money alſo, and for that purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them a Right to Fiſh in all ſecular Ponds, and Rivers: For, <hi>The Kings of the Earth</hi> (ſays Chriſt to <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>from whom do they receive
<pb facs="tcp:49655:11"/>Tribute? not certainly from us, for we are free: But go thou to the Sea, and caſt forth a hook, and take up the firſt Fiſh that cometh up; that take, and when thou haſt opened his mouth, thou ſhalt find a piece of money, that take.</hi> And by this a great fiſhing right was eſtabliſhed in him, and from him derived to his Succeſſors, that is, to <hi>fiſh in all waters;</hi> now by <hi>Waters</hi> the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures intend People, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Tongues, and Languages: <hi>And Chriſt commanded</hi> Peter <hi>to lanch out into the Deep, and then they inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch a multitude of Fiſhes, that the net brake;</hi> and it was very well,
<note place="margin">Serm. 2. in Feſt. Petri.</note> and pertinently obſerved by Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> 3. that the meaning of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or command, <hi>Lanch out into the deep,</hi> was this, <hi>Go up to</hi> Rome, <hi>which had a vaſt dominion over all People, and from whence they might ſpread their Nets over all the World, to catch all Nations.</hi> And ſo in purſuance of this Right, this Fiſhing Trade for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hath been driven with all poſſible art, and induſtry all the World over, to the great profit of the Roman Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:49655:12"/>
            <p>But in proceſs of time ſo it fell out, that ſeveral Kings, and States, looking upon theſe Romiſh Fiſhermen as Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers, and Intruders; after a due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and conſideration had of all the Pleas, and allegations in this matter, and canvaſſing the Pope's Title to a free Piſcary in all Waters, not only upon this Globe, but in the Coeleſtial, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Waters alſo; his Title was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and declared to be of no force, or value, and thereupon he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to <hi>fiſh</hi> any more in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Ocean, the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, the <hi>Lake Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> and in many Rivers of <hi>Germany;</hi> and he was in great danger of being prohibited fiſhing alſo in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Adriatick:</hi> ſo that what prizes he gets now amongſt us, it is by ſtealth, and now and then a few ſilly Fiſhes are drawn, and enticed into his Nets.</p>
            <p>But in many places ſtill the Trace is freely driven, with great returns, and profit; how formerly it was managed here, the enſuing Pages will make ſome diſcovery; as alſo how it came to be ſtop'd. But certainly vaſt Riches are continually brought in by the Factors of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thereby the Popes, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
<pb facs="tcp:49655:12"/>have mightily inriched Sons, Nephews, Relations, and Kindred, and oftentimes raiſed great Families, as thoſe of <hi>Borgia, Aldobrandini, Sfon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drati, Caraffi, Peretti,</hi> and many more. Yet I have lately met with a notable Obſervation of an intelligent Roman,
<note place="margin">Il Nipotiſmo di Roma. P. 2. lib. 3. fo. 163.</note> who with great reaſon, and experience informs, That ſeldom, or never any of thoſe Families proſper, but ſuddenly decay, and wither; And that if any one pleaſe but to run over the actions of all the Popes, and the Hiſtories of their Families, he will find it an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible truth, that they are all, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, or reduced unto a very mean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable condition; as if Heaven would not endure the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be made an univerſal ſcandal to the World, and be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of eternizing the memory of the Sacriledge they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>The Obſervator proceeding to give this further reaſon, Becauſe, ſays he, it ſo pleaſes God, not to ſuffer thoſe who have raiſed themſelves unto that greatneſs out of the Bowels of thoſe in Purgatory, to continue long without
<pb facs="tcp:49655:13"/>ſome ſignal mark of his diſpleaſure: Heaven is offended to ſee ſacred things transformed into profane: Alms into Theft: Churches into Palaces: Altars into Lordſhips: Holy things into Comedy, and ſport: Divine worſhip into Adoration of Riches, or rather Adoration into Riches.</p>
            <p>And as this was, and is one way ſtill, of employing the Churche's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>viz.</hi> to raiſe Families, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich <hi>Nephews,</hi> &amp;c. So you ſee what it comes to at laſt: And becauſe the Popes are generally choſen old men, their Kindred, and <hi>Nephews,</hi> as their diſcretion dictates, make the beſt uſe of their time, and with all greeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ingroſs all that they can, whilſt the old Gentleman is ſupported with Cordials: neither are they ſatisfied with what can be finger'd at preſent, but reverſions, and remainders muſt be ſecured alſo; Nay, to above five, or ſix of Pope <hi>Urban's</hi> little Cozens at one time there were Benefices, and preferments given, while they were yet rocking in their cradles: And ſometimes Benefices have been diſpoſed off to thoſe that were not
<pb facs="tcp:49655:13"/>yet born,
<note place="margin">Id. fo. 91.</note> for in the Articles of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not long ſince, of one of the <hi>Barberines,</hi> with a Lady of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Colonna,</hi> this was one, That a certain Abby ſhould be given to the Firſt-born Son.</p>
            <p>But now, Sir, I cannot but tell you of a certain difficulty, which I have often ruminated upon, being a great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, as I have conceiv'd, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: And that is, That this external Splendor, Glory, and Riches, ſhould by ſome be urged as an infallible mark of the True Church: To ſee the Majeſty of the Son of God ſet forth in the exaltation of the Pope his Vicegerent, ſeated in a glorious Throne; adorned with a Triple Crown, and other ſuitable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments; Emperours holding his ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop, and laying their necks before him to be trod upon; to ſee him ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Table by Kings; and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Toe to be kiſs'd with great reverence, and devotion by perſons of the higheſt quality, to ſee him aſſiſted by a conclave of glorious Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and with them appearing like the Major, and Aldermen of this
<pb facs="tcp:49655:14"/>bleſſed Corporation: All which, they fay, muſt needs be the Characteriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal marks of the true Vicar of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who, by his Royal <hi>Charter,</hi> hath inveſted his Subſtitute, and his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, with theſe Honours. When again, by others in the ſame Church, and thoſe of great repute amongſt them, the true marks, and ſigns of the Catholick-ſhip thereof are made to confiſt in wilful Poverty, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare-foot, and bare-leg'd, in watchings, faſting, and penances, in going attired in Sackcloth, tatter'd and lowſey rags, in ſhewing ſour, and mortified looks, and bloody backs; affirming, that for an eminence in theſe ſeverities, it was that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious St. <hi>Francis</hi> is now advanced to the vacant Throne of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the higheſt place in Heaven, becauſe he was the pooreſt wretch on Earth. I now ſay, to which of thoſe ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Characters, or marks, ſhall we apply our ſelves; and from whence, ſeeing they are not yet agreed amongſt themſelves, ſhall we take our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to pitch upon the true Church?
<pb facs="tcp:49655:14"/>whether from Riches, or Poverty; from Honour, or Contempt; from Rule, or Subjection; from a plump, or a macerated looks; from outward gorgeouſneſs, or poorneſs of ſpirit? I muſt confeſs my ſelf at a ſtand and ſhall take a little time to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>But I will detain you no longer with theſe ſpeculations: and for theſe ſubſequent remarks, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at your inſtance, I now put them into your hands; but if you ſuffer them to fall under the Eyes of any ſuch as ſhall be ſtartled, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at them, I know not how they will help themſelves: It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to anſwer Demonſtrations, and matters of fact, drawn from the moſt authentick Regiſters, and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto's of time, which hath been my work chiefly to exhibite. And if I ſhould have proceeded to have ſet forth all that train of vanities, and miſchiefs which attend Popery, it would have been infinite, and far exceeded my deſigned limits: beſides, it would be no news to you, who
<pb facs="tcp:49655:15"/>can far better decipher them than my ſelf. But for this which is already done, I give it wholly to your diſpoſe, as alſo is</p>

                  <note place="margin">Coke Juriſd. of Courts, cap. 14 Stat. 2 H. 4. cap. 1. 1 Ric. 2.</note> and in one Statute made to remedy that griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it was termed a <hi>Horrible Miſchief,</hi> and <hi>Damnable Cuſtome:</hi> and at another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it was call'd a <hi>Very Novelty.</hi>

               <p>But herein did the policy of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> notably appear, that ſometimes, when the Kingdom complain'd of its burdens, and the Kings in ſome exigency calling for the Subjects Aids, and thereupon the Pope's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in danger of a temporary, if not a total ſtop, the Popes would in ſuch a jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and perhaps in a frolick of bounty, concede or aſſign the Firſt Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ſome time to the King, as for one year, or more, as the occaſion ſeem'd to require: and in particular,

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> gave them to King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond to aid him againſt <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King. And this project ſerv'd excellently well, both to habituate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49655:22"/>the People to payment, and to win the Kings for their continuance, to whom they might be thus uſeful in any caſe of extremity. But the policy of after Parliaments went a reach beyond that of the Popes: for as a perpetual addition to the revenues of the Crown, they were by a Statute in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth given to the King, his Heirs,
<note place="margin">Stat 26 Hen. 8. cap. 3.</note> and Succeſſors for ever. And then for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of theſe Firſt Fruits, and Tenths, there was a Court erected <hi>An.</hi> 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.

<note place="margin">Stat. 27 Hen. 8. cap. 8.</note> none ſhall pay Tenths the ſame year that they pay Firſt Fruits, therefore they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The way now of Compoſition for Firſt Fruits, is for the Parſon Preſented, Admitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſufficient Sureties, to enter into Four Bonds, each conditioned for the payment of the Fourth part of the Firſt Fruits (deducting the Tenth, as aforeſaid,) the firſt Bond payable at half a years end: the ſecond Bond at a Twelve-moneths end: the third at a year and halfs end: and the fourth at two years end: and ſo the party hath two years time to pay the Firſt Fruits. And then by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. it is appointed, That if an Incumbent continue in his Benefice half a year after the laſt avoidance, and then dye, or be legally outed, before the end of the year, then he, his Executors, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrators, or Sureties, ſhall pay only a Fourth part of the Firſt Fruits: If he live out the year, and dye, or be outed within ſix moneths after the year, then only half the Firſt Fruits ſhall be paid: If he live out the year and half, and dye, or be outed within two years, then only three quarters thereof ſhall be paid: But if he live out two whole years, then the whole Firſt Fruits are to be paid: theſe Bonds being of like force as a Statute Staple. And thus the Firſt Fruits,

And it ſo hapned, that by reaſon of the multitude of Canons, as were put forth by divers Popes, of reſtrictions, and limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, very few Princely Families in <hi>Europe</hi> could at any time intermarry without Diſpenſations from ſuch, or ſuch a Canon, and then let the Pope alone for ſetting his own rates and prices upon his own Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>As great ſumms of money came thus to the Popes, upon their Diſpenſations in point of marriage: So frequently they made their advantages by diſpenſing with promiſes, Vows, and Oaths.

               <p>The Pope's practice in Diſpencing with Oaths brings to mind this ſtory,
<note place="margin">Helmold. in Chron. Slavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. cap. 29.</note> That when conteſt was between the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> 4. and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, the Pope Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates the Emperour and puts on <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> to rebel againſt him, in order to his depoſition, and abſolves the Duke of his Oath of Allegiance given to the Emperour: after which a Battle happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the Duke, and the Emperour; the Duke was mortally wounded in the right hand; which made him cry out to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, See you that this hand, with which I firſt made, and then broke my Oath of Allegiance to my lawful Soveraign, is thus ſtruck by the Divine vengeance; the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle whereof I pray God may work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the cauſers of my defection and perjury, as it hath done in me. Not long after which he expired miſerably, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorably.</p>
               <p>Once it was,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Zach. Pap. 2. Tom.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49655:37"/>marry a woman, that had firſt bin mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to his Uncle, and afterwards to a Counſin of his, from whom ſhe was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced, and he yet alive; beſides ſhe was his kinſwoman in the Third degree, and had bin a Nun: but it is thought the Pope was as much gravell'd at it, as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, for it doth not appear that he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charls</hi> the Eight, the <hi>French</hi> King,
<note place="margin">Phil. de Com. lib. 7. cap. 3. Arnold. Ferron de Reb. geſt. Gall. in vita Car. 8.</note> made great uſe of this diſpenſing power of the Popes; For this <hi>Charls</hi> had taken the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> King of the Romans, for his wife: but afterwards, to obtain the <hi>Duchy</hi> of <hi>Brittain,</hi> he Sollicited to marry <hi>Anne</hi> the heir thereof, though ſhe was betrothed, nay already marryed to <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> by his Proctor, openly in the Church: a double injury to <hi>Maximilian,</hi> to have her taken from him, whom he accounted his Wife; and to have his Daughter ſent home again, who had bin divers years Queen of <hi>France;</hi> but 'this was an eaſie thing for the Pope to do, as <hi>Phil. de Comines</hi> tells the ſtory at large: adding, that there was great diſputes, and arguments, in thoſe times, <hi>Pro, &amp; Con,</hi> whether thoſe actions could agree with Laws of Holy Church, or not; and relating, that the uſſues of thoſe Ladies became very unfortunate, and that many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities proceeded from thoſe marriages: but the intereſts of the Pope, and the <hi>French,</hi> being twiſted in this affair, he ſpared not to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49655:38"/>cut aſunder the ſacred bonds of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which had been made ſo ſolemnly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>By theſe practices the Popes acquired infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite advantage: for thereby they did not only in hand get great ſumms, or ſome other valuable conſiderations; but alſo oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſecured the favors of many, and of their poſterities alſo, whoſe eſtates, and legitimation depended altogether upon the validity of theſe purchaſed Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Theſe Diſpenſations were experienc'd the more miſchievous in this regard, that whereas the Popes gull'd the People of great ſumms of money other wayes, by the fineneſs of a <hi>pia fraus,</hi> where the common ſaying, <hi>volenti non fit injuria,</hi> might take ſome place: but here the eſtates, and fortunes of perſons, and families frequently became rent, and torn, by the ruinous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of theſe Diſpenſations: And hence all thoſe grievous complaints that have been made againſt them.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Conc. Trid lib. 7. fo. 676. vid. Terr. Torti. fo. 51.</note> In the very Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſpake ſtoutly, and freely againſt the abuſes of them, one <hi>Johannes Verdun;</hi> but it was not a time then to have his ſtory heard, ſo as to be regarded.</p>
               <p>Diſpenſations are ſtiled <hi>Legum Vulnera;</hi> and indeed when a Law is once, in the leaſt, wounded by a Diſpenſation, it proves ſuch a ſtab, that there is but little life left in it afterwards. Chriſt came not to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49655:38"/>diſſolve, but to fulfil the Law: but the Popes have made it a practiſe to diſſolve Laws, that they might fill full their own Coffers.</p>

               <p>INdulgences, and Pardons, ſhall in the next place be remembred, as moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful devices to draw money to <hi>Rome.</hi> And becauſe the import of theſe, generally, hath not been ſo well apprehended, we will take liberty to make a little enquiry into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vertue of them.</p>
               <p>In the Primitive Times, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had committed any hainous offence, as for example, either in denying their Faith, or ſacrificing to Idols, for fear of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the parties offending were injoyned ſome ſevere, and long Penance: and the rigour of this the Biſhops, and Paſtors had power (if they ſaw cauſe) to mitigate, at their diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which mitigation, or relaxation of Puniſhment, was called Indulgence, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. And this derived from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who releaſed the inceſtuous Corinthian from the bond of Excommunication, upon his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and ſerious repentance.</p>
               <p>And this manner of Indulgence was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and continued long in the Primitive Church: But the Indulgence in the Roman Church is of another nature: for ſeeing that Sin, as they ſay, deſerveth as well ſome Temporal puniſhment, as Eternal Damnation, their Indulgence is a ſuppoſed Abſolution
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49655:39"/>from the guilt of Temporal puniſhment,
<note place="margin">Vid. Pol. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil. de invent. rerum. lib. 8. cap. 1.</note> which puniſhment is inflicted, they ſay, in Purgatory; and all this, as they further add, by the application of the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Saints, by the medium, and method of the Church: and theſe merits are termed <hi>Theſaurus Eccleſiae, The Treaſure of the Church,</hi> and appliable to the ſouls of the dead burning in Purgatory, to work out their Temporal puniſhment. And this is the notion of Indulgence in the Roman Church, if I miſtake not, for it is a Doctrine as difficult to underſtand, as to maintain. But this is certain that theſe modern, new coin'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, differ infinitely from that of the Primitive Times; for thoſe which were firſt uſed for mitigation of Penance, or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are now reduced to be in ſtead of real private ſatisfactions: and that which was formerly left to the diſcretion of every Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his own Dioceſs, to diſpence, in that manner, with <hi>ſummum jus,</hi> is now ſolely transferred to the Power, and authority of the Pope: and that not only from Penances, and Puniſhments in this life, but alſo from impriſonment, pains, and tortures in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory for many thouſands of years: As, whoſoever in the ſtate of Grace ſhall ſay ſeven prayers before the Crucifix,

               <p>Now for thoſe people that were conſcious, and certain they were guilty of many ſins, and perſwaded they ſhould lye frying in Purgatory many thouſands of years, to purge themſelves, and make them fit for Heaven; who would not preſently unſtring, and give even almoſt all they were worth, for ſuch advantages, and to be freed from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49655:41"/>thoſe bitterly repreſented pains, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>Then to aſſure people they were not cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe penny-worths, and bargains, the Myſterie of the Pope's Triple Crown was ſufficient: for anciently, if not ſtill, the word,
<note place="margin">Myſterium.</note> 
                  <hi>Myſterium,</hi> was engraven thereon, to denote, and ſignifie the Rule, and Authority, the Pope bears in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in <hi>Earth,</hi> and in <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And ſo theſe Indulgences, and Pardons were trucked for, and bought up, at any rates: untill people began a little to conſider, and look about them, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon what terms, and for what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes theſe Indulgences were ſent abroad, wherein no diſtinction of perſons, or ſins was made, which reaſonably might have been expected from Chriſt's Vicar; that whoſoever performed ſome religious rites, and paid certain ſumms of money, ſhould have all their ſins forgiven, whatever they were: ſo that all men, who would come to the price, were not only promiſed everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, but made capable of delivering the ſouls of others out of Purgatory: conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, that in employing the money raiſed by theſe Indulgences, there was no regard had to the end for which they were given, but frequently,
<note place="margin">Centum gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam. Germar.</note> by way of anticipation, it was aſſigned to ſome other purpoſe, as to carry on the Popes revenge, to pay his debts, to gratifie a friend, to inrich a Nephew, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Neece, to wage a War, to ſubdue an Anti-pope, or the like: that all immaginable

<note place="margin">Hen. de Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Coll. fo. 2671.</note> and tricks were uſed to make the moſt of them, in regard they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally farmed out to the moſt cunning ſnaps, and ſuch as would give moſt for them. So that in time people began to be a little wary in laying out their money that way, and the Markets, and ſales for Indulgences began to be very cold: but then the Collectors, and Factors would ſell the cheaper penny-worths, and play at ſmall games before they would give out; as once in <hi>Germany,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An. Dom. 1520.</note> when theſe wares began to be a little out of credit, the Pope's Officers would ſell them for a very ſmall price,
<note place="margin">Cuicciard. Hiſt. lib. 13. fo. 629.</note> or play at Tables for them in Taverns, and Gaming-Houſes, wherein mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was ſtaked againſt Pardons eſteemed of ſuch a value.
<note place="margin">Vid. Hiſt. Concil.

               <p>Now, as well to ſhew the liberality of the Popes, in granting theſe Indulgences, as alſo ſomewhat further to explicate the nature of them; we will here take a view of ſuch <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> and <hi>Pardons,</hi> as formerly have been granted to ſome of the Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> as they are ſpecified in an old Book called, <hi>The Cuſtomes of London,</hi> as follows.</p>

                  <p>And thus, with the propoſal, and belief of theſe heavenly advantages, men, women, and Children, of all qualities, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually drawn, and enticed to <hi>Rome,</hi> at their great charges, and expences, to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe tranſcendant graces. But to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49655:47"/>ſhew the Popes charity, and liberality in theſe gracious Indulgences, we muſt know that they were granted alſo to many Churches, and Altars within this Kingdom, like cummin Seeds, moſt commonly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil'd upon the walls.</p>
                  <p>Againſt an Altar, thus:</p>

                     <hi>Si quis Miſſam ad hoc Altare fieri curabit,

Nihil Certius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe home Indulgences were never eſteem'd ſo powerful, and effectual, as thoſe which were far fetch'd, and dear bought. And the profit accruing to the Popes, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by vertue of theſe, was exceſſive great, and alwayes, ſince their firſt contrivance, eſteemed one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſupports of the revenues of that See. And for the improvement thereof, theſe Romiſh Indulgences were ſometimes made Itinerant, and ſent abroad into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, under the managery of Commiſſioners, to be delivered out, and diſpenced for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to ſuch as could not travel to <hi>Rome</hi> for them: (of which more anon, when we come to the Jubiles.)</p>
                  <p>Thus Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth,
<note place="margin">Hiſt. of Counc. of Tient lib. 1. ſect. 13.</note> a man very liberal in rewarding his kindred, and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49655:47"/>when ſome other fountains were dryed up, whence riches uſed to be drawn out of other Nations to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> thought fit to ſerve himſelf of that of Indulgences; and ſped ſo well in that project, that he gave to divers perſons the Revenues of divers Provinces, reſerving ſomething to his own Exchequer: and particularly he gave the Indulgences of <hi>Saxony,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. Sect. 16.</note> and of that arme of <hi>Germany</hi> which reacheth from thence to the Sea ſide, to his Siſter <hi>Magdalen,</hi> the wife of <hi>Franceſchetto Cibo,</hi> baſtard Son of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth, in recompence of the charges which the family of <hi>Cibo</hi> were at, when he retired himſelf to them at <hi>Genoa</hi> under <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth.</p>
                  <p>And hence it was,
<note place="margin">Id. Sect. 27.</note> that <hi>Franciſcus Sode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Praeneſte,</hi> called Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Volterra,</hi> told Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth, That no Reformation could be made, that would not notably diminiſh the Rents of the Church, which having four fountains, one Temporal, <hi>viz.</hi> the Rents of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Eſtate: the other three ſpiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> Indulgences, Diſpenſations, and Collations of Benefices; none of them could be ſtopp'd, but that one quarter of the Revenues would be cut off.</p>
                  <p>The Exemplification of the Holy Pardons at <hi>Rome</hi> before, acquaints us how thoſe graces were, and are there delivered out by whole-ſale, and in groſs ſumms: but there were ſome men that thought it ſurer to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them, as it were, by retail: and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49655:48"/>others again thought they were not ſure enough without they had them under hand, and ſeal, and the Pope's general warranty to them: thus,</p>

               <p>Then, for theſe, and all the other precious things before mentioned, ſuch vertue was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, that ſcarce any that had money, would ſtick to give the rates ſet upon them: eſpecially when it was given out, and believed, they had power, and vertue, to fortifie againſt Temptations: infuſe, and ſtrengthen grace: fright, and drive away the Devil, and all evil ſpirits: allay winds, and tempeſts: purifie the air: ſecure from thunder, and lightning: ſtop all raging infections, and contagions; and be as panpharmacons againſt all diſeaſes: with a multitude more benefits, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which they brought to the poſſeſſors of them: All which, I ſay, being conſidered, who would be without ſuch precious things, when they might be had for money?

               <p>And beſides the price of theſe Reliques, and Wares, at the firſt hand, many of the more famous ſort of them were made daily pick-pockets to multitudes who brought their devotion, and offerings in vows, and pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to them, when they were kept, and expos'd at ſome famous place.

<note place="margin">Lambert Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amb. of Kent, in Boxley.</note> An Engliſh Artiſt being taken Priſoner, in the warrs between us and <hi>France,</hi> and wanting money for his ranſome, ſet his wits on work, to make ſome famous piece, and having got ſome materials, he made a curious Rood, the like had never bin ſeen,
<note place="margin">The Rood of Grace at Box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> for it's geſtures, and moving all it's Joints, as bowing the head, lifting up it's ſelf, rolling the eyes, ſhaking the hands,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49655:55"/>knitting the brows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he got leave, upon his parol, to bring it into <hi>England,</hi> to ſell, and make money of it for a ranſome, and layd it on the back of a Jade, which he drove before him: coming to <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and ſtaying there, to drink, the Jade went forwrds, a way not intended by the Maſter, and ſtayed not till he came to <hi>Boxly,</hi> and running to the <hi>Abby</hi> Church dore, he made ſuch a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bouncing againſt the dore with his heels, that at the noiſe the <hi>Abbot,</hi> and Monks came, and open'd the dore, which no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner done, but the beaſt ruſh'd in, and ran to a certain piller, and there ſtood: whilſt the monks were buſie in taking off the load, in comes the owner puffing, and ſweating, and ſatisfying them that the Jade, with his load, was his property, endeavours to lead him out of the Church, but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his beating, and pulling, the reſty beaſt would not ſtir one inch from the piller; then he takes off the Image, thinking to carry it away himſelf, but that would not ſtir neither, and therefore after much heaving, and lifting to no purpoſe, they all thought that God had ſent, and deſtin'd it to that Houſe, like another <hi>Palladium,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Abbot,</hi> and Monks giving the Maſter his price for it, they ſet it up juſt at that piller, where it ſtood for many years, doing rare feats, to the inriching of the Houſe, till it was eaſily removed to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs, and there uncaſed, as you have heard before.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:49655:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>In the ſame Church there was alſo the Image of St.
<note place="margin">S. Rumwald.</note> 
                  <hi>Rumwald,</hi> which was a very ſmall one, the repreſentation of a Boy-Saint: and the uſe of this Image was this; If you were minded to have any Benefit by the Rood of Grace, you muſt be ſhriven by one of the Monks firſt, and then by lifting at this St. <hi>Rumwald,</hi> proof was made whether you were in clean life, as they ſaid, or no; and if you proved to be clean, then was your way made for your offering to be accepted before the holy Rood: If you were not clean, which was known by your not being able to lift that little Image, then you muſt be confeſs'd again, on preſumption you had conceal'd ſome foul ſins. But then here was the trick on't, the Image being ſmall, hollow, and light, that a Child of ſeven years old might eaſily lift it, there was a divice to faſten it to a poſt with a pin of wood, which a Knave ſtanding behind could put in, and out as he liſt, which pin being put in, the ſtrongeſt man could not ſtir it: and then when any perſon offered bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, the pin was pulled out, that he might eaſily lift it; but to one that prov'd ſtingy, the Image would not ſtir at all: and ſo, in ſtead of devotion, this frequently proved great paſtime, to ſee a great lubberly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tugge, and lift in vain, at that which a Boy, or Girl, had eaſily took up before him.

               <p>We will pack, and ſhut up this ſhow of Reliques with this one more memorable: In the raign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the Teeth of St. <hi>Apollonia</hi> were in great eſteem, as conceived effectuall to cure the Tooth-ach, and for that purpoſe were bought by many ignorant people, and carryed about with them: this being notified to the King, order was given, that all her Teeth ſhould be brought in to a publick officer appointed to receive them, which being done, they filled a Tunne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: and ſo the cheat was diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of the nature, and uſe of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49655:57"/>theſe Reliques, together with the Saints to whom they were affirmed to have belonged, the Miracles, and cures ſaid to be wrought by them; and alſo the Indulgences, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the laſt Chapter before; unriddles to me a certain difficulty, which hath puzled divers to give a ſatisfactory reaſon for: And that is, why the livings in <hi>London</hi> were antiently eſteemed of ſo great value and ſo highly rated in the Kings Books, for firſt Fruits, and Tenths, when it is well known the Tiths, and Church dues there, are very ſmall, and inconſiderable, compared to the Country Livings, whoſe certain profits, by reaſon of the predial Tiths, far out-ſtrip thoſe of <hi>London.</hi> And certainly this was the reaſon, becauſe every Church in <hi>London</hi> was furniſhed either with ſome famous Saint, ſome precious Relique, ſome gracious Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, ſome wonderful Miracle, or ſome other <hi>pia fraus,</hi> whereby, and whereunto, people were continually enticed to be ſuppliants and viſitors, with their vows, and offerings: as at one Church was a Saint celebrated for giving eaſie travel to big-bellyed women: Another gave ſafety to Merchants, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, in their Sea voyages: here was cure for ſuch a diſeaſe; and there for another: ſo that at every Church there was ſomething virtual, and peculiar, to draw cuſtomers, and profit to the Prieſts. And then <hi>London</hi> being the Metropolis of the Kingdom, unto which people flocked from all quarters, both natives, and ſtrangers, and none but had
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49655:58"/>their Special, and proper deſigns, griefs, and difficulties, or at leaſt curioſities, for which, if they wanted eaſe or ſatisfaction, there, as they were told, they might be ſure at one place, or other, to find it. And ſo the Prieſts never wanted vent, or cuſtomers for their wares; as <hi>Mountebanks, Juglers, Punchinello</hi>'s, and ſuch like, with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, chooſe to open, and ſhow at Fairs, and at times, and places of the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, and concourſe of people. But then at the Reformation, when all theſe cheats were detected, and exploded, and the Churches cleared of them, and the Prieſts reduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſtanding legal revenues of Tiths, and Church dues:
<note place="margin">Stat. 37 Hen. 8. cap. 12.</note> then all thoſe City livings fell ſo low, that the Pariſh dues reſpectively proved too ſmall to maintain one Prieſt: And thereupon the King, and State thought good, to make proviſion by a Decree, confirmed by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the Parſons, and Miniſters in <hi>London</hi>-ſhould have a mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by the payment of the ſumm of two ſhillings and nine pence out of every Twenty ſhillings <hi>Per annum</hi> rent of Houſes, ſhops, &amp;c. without which they could not have ſubſiſted. And more lately,

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49655:61"/>thei compound for, effectually to pay to the ſeyd Comiſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the Pope's Charity alſo to impart theſe Graces, and the benefits of a Jubile, to all Countreys under his Spiritual Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon ſuch, and the like terms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; whereby Grace, and Heaven were bought, and ſold, as firm as any goods in a Market overt.</p>
                  <p>By vertue of all theſe proviſions you ſee how eaſie it was at laſt for all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to attain the benefits, and happineſs of a Jubile; where Pardons, and Indulgences might be had as cheap as heart could wiſh. Nay, who would not ſcrape, and run, and give all he was worth, at ſuch an opportunity, for ſo mighty an advantage, as the pardon of all his ſins? A far more bleſſed time this, than that of the Hebrew Jubile, when only the Bondmen of their own Country were made free, and poſſeſſions returned again to their firſt owners: But here was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained freedom from the bondage of ſin, and the Devil; and Livery, and Seiſin of an eternal Inheritance in the Heavens. In a belief whereof, there were ſeen perſons of all ſorts, ſexes, and ages, flocking and crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to participate of this Holy, and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſure: Old men rejoycing they had liv'd to ſee ſo happy a day; and young men catching at the opportunity, leſt they ſhould not live the revolution of another Jubile: And thoſe that could not go themſelves, if
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49655:62"/>they ſent but mony enough, all was well enough.</p>
                  <p>Then, as theſe Jubile's were celebrated at ſome ſtated times; the Pilgrimages were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and performed daily, and by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and that upon ſeveral accounts: for,</p>

The Pilgrim travelled to ſome certain deſigned place, or places, but the Palmer to all. The Pilgrim went at his own charges, but the Palmer proſeſt wilful
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49655:63"/>poverty, and went upon Alms. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim might give over his Profeſſion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, but the Palmer muſt be conſtant, till he had obtained the Palme, that is, Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over all his ſpiritual Enemies, and Life, by Death; and thence his name Palmer; or elſe from a ſtaff, or boughs of Palme, which always he carryed along with him.

                     <note place="margin">Beda Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 4. cap. 23.</note> there was at all times obſerved a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Engliſh to flock thither upon thoſe accounts, than of any other Nation; diſtance always increaſing ſuch kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: And this hath made me ſometimes reflect upon an uſual Obſervation of our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, who deſcribing the Genius, Manners, Cuſtoms, and behaviours of the Italians, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them as moſtly ſymbolizing with the Engliſh, and far more correſponding than the French, Spaniard, or any other Nation not ſo diſtant from us: And therefore I have been apt to think this agreement, or likeneſs might be wrought, in ſome meaſure at leaſt, by that great, and long intercourſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication as formerly was uſed between the Italians, and the Engliſh, multitudes of them coming over hither for preferment, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49655:63"/>upon ſeveral other accounts, as may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from divers inſtances in theſe Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; but far greater numbers of ours run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thither upon infinite occaſions, part whereof we have already touched, and ſhall note ſome others in the ſubſequent periods of our diſcourſes: And the Obſervation of a late Traveller favours this apprehenſion very much, who ſpeaking of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Travels of Jo.

And indeed, as the occaſions of running, and flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome</hi> were infinite, ſo many that went thither, never came back again, reſolving to lay their bones in that holy ground; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others over-grown with a longing zeal,

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49655:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>zeal, and liberality, to ſo little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as they thought; in regard thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by reaſon of their vicinity to them, and experienc'd inefficacy, were by them contemned: whilſt on the contrary, they themſelves, in a like ſtrain of Fanatick zeal, or devotion, would run to St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtella,</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> or to our St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or further, to ſhew they could be as fond, and liberal in our quarters, as we had been in theirs.</p>
               <p>And hence it was that the Shrines, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, of many Saints became ſo exceſſive rich. What vaſt treaſure, in Jewels, Gold, and Silver,

So, for the reaſons aforeſaid, great quantities of our Engliſh Gold, Silver, Jewels, &amp;c. were ſwallowed up in the Treaſuries of Saints beyond the Seas, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> and at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt Treaſure, of that nature, thought to be in the world at this day, is at the Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> eſteemed ſufficient, if ſo imployed, to maintain a Warr againſt the Turks many years: the ſame being daily increaſed by Gifts, and offerings from thoſe who have an eſteem to the pretended Sanctity of the place. This Treaſury being ſhewed to Strangers, and Travellers, with admiration they behold,

               <p>Now, to ſhew that all the Gifts, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and Bounty did not always run to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but that ſometimes there were <hi>Veſtigia pauca retrorſum,</hi> we find that ſometimes, and on ſome occaſions, the Pope would ſend, as tokens of his grace, and benediction, ſome preſents hither again, of which we will produce a few inſtances.</p>

               <p>Theſe Courts, at firſt were pretended to be inſtituted for Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and cauſes only; But then, at the inſtance of Eccleſiaſtical perſons, many of the <hi>Laicks</hi> were cited to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make Anſwer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning buſineſſes not at all belonging to the Cognizance of that Court, as matters of <hi>Inheritances, Gages, Pawns, Contracts,</hi> &amp;c.

And thereupon the Pope's Judges, and Officers ſpared not to diſturb all other places of Judicature, in dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the King's authority, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating all that would not obey them.</p>
               <p>And theſe Courts, as they were manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, became an accumulative charge, and burden to the people: For the right of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage belonging to divers Lay, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical perſons, was (under Colour of Prevention, or Proviſion) by the power and authority of theſe Courts, uſurped by the Pope, his Legats, and Officers, when Benefices were vacant; and then the ſame uſually conferred on Courtiers, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, <hi>Italians,</hi> and Strangers: And theſe men dying, either at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in their way thither, or thence, their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

               <p>In theſe Courts alſo Excommunications were often denounced for trifles, but not taken off without great charge.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Elections of Popes, and Cardinals.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Election, and making of Popes, and Cardinals was another way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying great ſumms frequently out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> And that upon this account.</p>
               <p>The Pope being both a ſpiritual Monarch, and a Temporal Prince, it could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, but by that ſway which he bore in the Conſciences of ſuch as owned his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he came to have a great influence over all the State affairs of Chriſtendome, beſides his challenging a power to depoſe Kings, abſolve Subjects of their Oaths of Allegiance, diſpence with Vows, and Oaths, and diſpoſe of Kingdoms, and States as he pleaſed: and then the Kings, and States of <hi>Europe</hi> acting according to their reſpective rules of State, and Policy, there continually happen'd a reciprocation, and recurrence of Treaties, Leagues, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, Quarrels, and Warrs amongſt them: And the Popedome being Elective, all thoſe Princes, and States (amongſt whom our Kings had their proper concerns) made it their intereſt, and utmoſt endeavour, in a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49655:83"/>vacancy, to procure the promotion of ſuch a one to that <hi>See,</hi> as might be favourable, or at leaſt not noxious, to their intereſts, and deſigns. And hence all the ſubtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, the ſecret Cabals, ſometimes the twiſting, and at other times the unravelling of intereſts, and factions, the canvaſſing of parties, the buying of votes, the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of intelligence, the bribing of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and any thing, or every thing that money would do, muſt be ſet on foot, and carryed on with utmoſt vigour, coſt, and pains. At ſuch a time, and occaſion <hi>Rome</hi> becomes throng'd with Ambaſſadors, and Agents, with their Guards, and Retinue, from all quarters, and all at a vaſt expence, watching, labouring, and ſweating, every one for his Maſter's buſineſs: whilſt the roads are peſter'd with Meſſengers, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and Poſts, carrying, and re-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of News, intelligence, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>Then, by reaſon of all this packing, and canvaſſing, it often happens that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave cannot agree in many moneths, though generally thoſe Princes who had bin moſt liberal, have had their turns ſerv'd; and many times again, by reaſon of the fierce oppoſition, and difficulties, the Cardinals, not to diſguſt the contending factions, are fain to pitch upon ſome heavy, old, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown man, who is likely to do neither hurt, nor good, or at leaſt not long, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49655:84"/>ſometimes again the Conclave becomes ſo divided, and rent, that one part of them chooſes a Pope, and another part an Anti-Pope, and when theſe (with their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans) have for ſome time ſcuffl'd, tug'd, and fought for't, in comes a third dog, and catches the hare from them both: and ſometimes three Popes have been up, and in play at one time. In this hurly-burly St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s chair is overturn'd, and broke in pieces; one Pope ſnatches up part of it, and runs into <hi>Germany;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcrambles for another part, and runs with it into <hi>France;</hi> whilſt another pieces up the remaining ſhivers, and ſeats him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at <hi>Rome.</hi> Preſently the world is fill'd with complaints, Remonſtrances, and Manifeſto's: The Emperour ſtorms, and ſayes his man had foul play, and that his Imperial Eagle ſhall fly his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pitch to do him right: The ſurly <hi>Spaniard</hi> grumbles, and proteſts he will hazard all his Indies, before his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be ſo baffled: And the <hi>French</hi> King ſwears that all his <hi>Flowers de Lis</hi> ſhall wither, before his Confident ſhall be rooted out: neither are our Kings of <hi>England</hi> only lookers on whilſt this game is in playing, but either their Arms, or their money, muſt be layd to ſtake on one ſide.</p>
               <p>In this Battle-Royal, after many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, and ran-counters, the weakeſt,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49655:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>though not alwayes the worſt, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly goes to the Walls: one of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſent out of the world with a Fig, or a Potion: another entrapp'd, and thrown into a Dungeon: whilſt the third, for a few moneths, or it may be years, ſtruts up and down, claps his wings, and crows as victor; and then goes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Pot, and leaves the Pit for other Combatants, and the ſpectators to their expectation of more ſport.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons up ſix and twenty ſchiſms in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> a more exact accountant,

The Contemplation whereof hath cauſed ſome to make a very ſhrewd objection, againſt the perfect unity, compleat ſucceſſion, and Divine Infallibility, ſo much boaſted of in that Church.</p>
               <p>I might, and could eaſily here make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance of all theſe famous bickerings, ſcuffles, and counter-ſcuffles: but the ſame being obvious to all that converſe with books,

At all which the Pope was ſo gall'd, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt him thus, What means this old dotard, this ſurd abſurd man, thus to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign our actions; By <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> I could find in my heart to make him a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful example to all the World: Is not the King of <hi>England</hi> our Vaſſal, and both he, and his, at our pleaſure? But ſome of the more temperate Cardinals endeavour'd to allay the Pope's heat, telling him the Biſhop had ſaid nothing,

               <p>Obſervable alſo is it, upon theſe incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and extorſions, how ſometimes our Kings would deſpond, and tamely ſuffer the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49655:104"/>Popes, and their Legates to grow upon them: and at other times rouze up themſelves, and give ſome check to their inſolencies: As K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. though a facile man, yet was once ſo inrag'd againſt <hi>Rubeus,</hi> that he bad him be gone out of his Kingdom in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's name. And as theſe exactions were at the height in that King's time, yet his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors did not always ſuffer them ſo to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, being forced to ſet ſome bounds to thoſe avaricious torrents,
<note place="margin">Pol. Vergil. Hiſt. in Ric 2. lib. 20.</note> by the Statutes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors, and Premunire: and oftentimes to give ſtout denials, to unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; as the Engliſh Clergy themſelves, at laſt,
<note place="margin">Lo. Herb. Hen. 8. fo. 57, 59.</note> adventured to do, in the years 1515. and 1518.</p>
               <p>And obſervable alſo is it, that <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> though moſt zealous for the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet in reſtoring the Pope's Supremacy, ſhe and the State were very cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, like thoſe whom others harms had made to beware; and ſome prudent proviſions were made in that behalf:
<note place="margin">Stat. 1 &amp; 2 Phil. &amp; mar. cap. 8. Coke 3. Inſtit. cap. 4. fo. 127.</note> neither were the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Premunire</hi> repeal'd in all her raign; but the Pope's Supremacy was reſtor'd, not <hi>ſimpliciter,</hi> but <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> as bounded within ſome legal limitations. But her raign was ſhort, and not pleaſant, and the Pope wanted time to work her for his purpoſe, for having got his head in, he did not doubt but by degrees to thruſt in his whole body: for it is ever obſervable, that in the Papal concerns there is no moderation, for they muſt have all, or nothing, let their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49655:104"/>and promiſes, at firſt admiſſion, be what ever they will. And whatever Prince, or State ſhall once admit of any Papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority within their Dominions, their deſtiny may eaſily be read, that they, and their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt for ever after be ſlaves, or if they once begin to boggle, or kick, the Caſuiſts have legitimated many ways to rid them out of the World, for the advancement of the Catholick cauſe, and the propagation of the Roman Faith.</p>
               <p>Now, after this imperfect Account given of the Rents, and Revenues of the Popes, heretofore iſſuing out of this Kingdom, if any one ſhall deſire to have ſome eſtimate made of the ſumms, I muſt profeſs it beyond the reach of my Arithmetick, and when I ſee any Accountant do it, <hi>Erit mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> Yet this is certain, that they were very vaſt: Otherwiſe there was no ground for that Complaint, which was made by the Kingdom's Repreſentative in the raign of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

               <p>HItherto our Collections have reached only to mention, or point at ſuch ſumms of money as heretofore went out of <hi>England</hi> to the Popes, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt they excercifed any power here. Now, if I ſhould proceed to ſpecifie the other vaſt ſumms of money, as yearly, nay daily iſſued out of the King's publick Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and the People's private purſes, upon the ſcore of Popery, and as appurtenant thereunto, ſpent and expended within the Kingdom, to vain, inſignificant, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious purpoſes; I ſhould tire my Reader with multitudes of particulars, and yet ſhame my ſelf, in falling ſo infinitely ſhort of ſuch an Account as Truth would make: And therefore I ſhall only hint briefly at ſome heads, or generals of the ſame.</p>

               <p>Then the Votaries that entered into theſe Abbies, Monaſteries, and Nunneries, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes carryed their portions, and eſtates along with them: and by themſelves, or their friends, gave either Lands, Goods, Plate, Jewels, Copes, Veſtments, or ſome other Ornament, at their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into one of the Convents: as many Engliſh do at this day, upon their entrance into religious houſes, and Orders, beyond the Seas.</p>
               <p>Theſe Houſes were alſo wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd by the burials of great Perſons in them:
<note place="margin">Weaver Pun.

And Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> makes mention of ſome of the Honourable family of the <hi>Haſtings,</hi> that lye buryed in the Grey Fryers, at <hi>Coventre,</hi> in the very habits of Fryers Minors: Proceeding, that this Orders of Fryers was ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by the generality of people, that by the Bequeſts, and Teſtaments of moſt men, and women, of abilities, it appears that formerly they ſeldom neglected to give
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49655:110"/>more, or leſs to one, or other religious Houſe of this Rule: and if they were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of quality, they commonly made choice of their Sepulture in one of them. Neither was it the leaſt policy of theſe Fryers to obtain from great perſons ſuch a diſpoſal of their bodies, conſidering how they were generally employed, and truſted in making their Wills, and Teſtaments: for where ever they ſped in that kind, they were ſure to have a good Legacy from the Teſtator, and not without hope, by ſo fair an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to obtain no leſs advantage by his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Walſingham,</hi>

Theſe, as all the Fryers of the like Orders, challenged ſomething as their due from the bodies of great men dying, like a company of dogs ſnatching every one at a piece of a dead Carcaſs: Thus <hi>Walſingham,</hi> being a Monk, out of envy, ſpared not to ſnarle at the nimble Fryers; who, no doubt but ſome time or other would be even with him, and thoſe of his Order.</p>
               <p>Then theſe Profeſſed Monks, and Fryers,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49655:110"/>upon their viſiting, and confeſſing of the ſick, alwayes uſed the moſt perſwaſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments they could, for the ſick perſon to beſtow ſomething toward maintenance of their Fraternities, or repairing of their Covents: and that he would bequeath his Body to be buryed in the Church of their Covent, promiſing they would daily ſay Prayers, and Maſſes, for his ſoul's eaſe in, and releaſe out of Purgatory. And by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſuch as were in health, they frequently injoined ſuch penances, as made to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the ſinners purſe, but their own profit.</p>
               <p>Of the Exorbitances of theſe cloiſter'd Monks, and Fryers, many examples might be produced, as of their Ribauldry, Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Quarelling, Fighting, Idleneſs, Cheating, Thieving, Debauchery, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all maintain'd by the People's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: but we will here content our ſelves with one inſtance only.

And that all theſe Prieſts, before their admiſſion to theſe Chanterys, ſhould take their corporal Oaths to obſerve all the Orders to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt power. And this Ordination, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſeveral other particulars, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Canons of <hi>Kenilworth,</hi> Rectors of the Church; by <hi>John de Chelmeſcote Vicar;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Free-Chappels,</hi> were ſuch as were founded,
<note place="margin">Free-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels.</note> and endowed, and had no relation unto, or dependance on a Mother-Church; (ſaving only the right of Sepulture:) and theſe were greater than Chanterys, having greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and more room for Prieſts, and more Prieſts for that room, to fing Maſs, and pray for the ſouls of the Founders, and others, according to the inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colledges</hi> were Foundations of like nature,
<note place="margin">Colledges.</note> and though fewer in number, yet were richer than both the former: amongſt which the Colledge of <hi>Fotheringhay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Speed Catal. in Northampt.</note> in <hi>Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> was yearly valued at four hundred nineteen pounds, eleven ſhillings, ten pence,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49655:113"/>half-penny. For the Offices, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Prieſts in theſe, and the <hi>Free-Chappels</hi> maintained, they were much of the nature of <hi>Chanterys,</hi> of which enough before.</p>
               <p>Now, the yearly value of all thoſe Lands, Tenements, Rents, and Revenues, which were ſetled upon theſe <hi>Abbys, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterys, Nunnerys, Chanterys, Colledges,</hi> and <hi>Free-Chappels,</hi> without doubt was as vaſt, as to us now unknown; the Pope being better able to give an account of them, at this day, than we our ſelves: for they ſay that Rentals, and Particulars of all thoſe Lands, and revenues, are ſtill kept upon the file, in the Pope's ſtudy, that great Landlord of the world, in expectation, and hope, they will once revert to their former uſe, and behoof: but the generous Engliſh will not eaſily be gull'd, and they will not be wheadled, by Romiſh Arguments, out of their Eſtates.</p>
               <p>In the next place,
<note place="margin">Shrines, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Reliques, &amp;c.</note> Shrines, Images, Reliques, Indulgences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a multitude of places within the Kingdom, daily drew great ſumms out of the People's purſes, both in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, and purchaſing, and donation of ſuch precious Commodities, and in daily reſorting to them afterwards with Vows, and Offerings. But theſe being of the ſame nature, and <hi>ejuſdem farinae,</hi> with thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſewhere, of which enough before, we will trouble you no more with them here.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:49655:113"/>
               <p>So the Commanding,
<note place="margin">Diſpenſations.</note> and forbidding many things, wherein Diſpenſations might be had from Courts, and Officers here; as certain obſtacles of marriage; the uſe, and difference of meats; vows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all to be redeem'd for money.</p>
               <p>Many wandring Mountebank Prieſts went up and down the Country,
<note place="margin">Mountebank Prieſts.</note> preaching the lives of ſome holy men, and Saints; and promiſing the ſimple people, that if they vowed themſelves to thoſe Saints, and payd ſomething in hand, and ſuch a yearly tribute, they ſhould be freed from ſuch diſeaſes as they deſired.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops had divers wayes,
<note place="margin">Biſhops, and Prieſts.</note> and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to ſcrue money out of the Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; and then thoſe Prieſts, to heal themſelves, were forced to cheat, and wring money out of the people.</p>
               <p>Great,
<note place="margin">Conſecrations.</note> and frequent expences were had in Conſecrating, and hallowing of Churches, Church-yards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Baptizing of Bells; making, repairing, apparelling, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Images; and ſuch like matters: for upon pretence that theſe, or any of theſe, were prophaned, by ſeveral and trifling wayes; then all muſt be conſecrated anew, and the Pariſh, and the People Aſſeſſed, and conſtrained to pay deeply for it. And of this kind of grievances, great complaints were often made.</p>
               <p>Many Courts were alſo in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Courts.</note> to which citations, and ſummons were made; and therein People continually vexed, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49655:114"/>and excommunicated; and thence diſmiſſed never, till exceſſive ſumms were extorted, and payd: the aggrieved partys not daring to appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> for fear of more exceſſive charges. Nay the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in, and the grievances growing by theſe Courts, as they were innumerable, ſo no other way tolerable, but that all was to be redeemed for money. And one pretty trick the Eccleſiaſtical Judges had in theſe Courts; that when the buſineſs of matrimony had proceeded ſo farr, that one of the partys had pretended a Contract, which the other denyed, and that ſome gifts, as earneſts of love, or marriage, had paſſed between them, the Eccleſiaſtical Judges, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the partys, would keep the gifts for themſelves, as forfeited, or eſcheated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viſitors,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Viſitors &amp;c.</note> and Synodal Judges, travelling about the Country, with a numerous retinue of Advocates, Proctors, Notaries, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, Summoners, Servants, Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Officers, under Colour of viſiting of Churches, Chappels, and Pariſhes, were a very great burden, and charge to the People where ever they came, ſcruing money upon every pretence out of their pockets, as they pleaſed, beſides annual ſumms claimed as due; making themſelves ſtalking-horſes, whereby any man might ſatisfie his revenge, or malice upon his Neighbour, upon Complaint, Suggeſtion, or information, of wrongs done, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons broke; whereupon ſentences, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49655:114"/>Condemnations, and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, with all rigour, followed, to the utter undoing of many men, the inriching the Judges, and Officers, but never turning to any avail, or ſatisfaction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant. Theſe Itinerants alſo extorted great ſumms, as they pleaſed, weekly, monethly, or yearly, from Uſurers, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Scriveners, Bakers, Butchers, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallers, Phyſitians, Surgeons, Midvives, Schoolmaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Private Confeſſions,
<note place="margin">Confeſſions.</note> as they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, were the more frequently, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively abuſed, for the drawing moneys out of men; in regard the cheat was cloſely handled, whilſt the Sinner's conſcience was quieted, and the world ſerved with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick penance, or ſome viſible addreſſes to theſe Confeſſors.</p>
               <p>The new Doctrine,
<note place="margin">Purgatory.</note> and invention of Purgatory, bred by Superſtition, and nurſed by Covetouſneſs, as it was managed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt forceable engine, continually to drain the People's money. For when men were made to believe, that after death their Souls ſhould enter into a region of Fire, there to ſuffer long, and bitter torments, to be purged, and fitted for the region of bliſs: but yet to be eaſed there, and the ſooner releaſed, according to the meaſure, and number of the Maſſes, Offices, and Prayers, which ſhould be made on their behalf here, whilſt they lay broiling in that fearful State: People were put upon it, to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49655:115"/>make the beſt proviſion they could in their life-time, or at leaſt at their deaths, that ſuch helps, and means ſhould be uſed, on their behalf, as they might reaſonably reckon upon a ſhort, and tolerable continuance there.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe the Founding, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of Monaſteries, Abbys, Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys, by the beſt, and richer ſort, and the Colledges, Free-Chappels, and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terys, by the middle ſort of people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſpective abilitys, and the apprehenſions they had of this future State, all pointed at the good of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's ſoul after death, and the ſouls of ſuch others as he appointed; of which we have had ſomething before.</p>
               <p>But then, alas, for thoſe poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whoſe ſmall eſtates, and narrowneſs of fortunes, would not reach to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, what would become of them? Theſe then were put to it, to make the beſt ſhift they could for themſelves; by endeavouring in their life-time, to get an intereſt in the favour, and merit of ſome Saint, and by purchaſing, and getting all the Indulgences they could: for it was a very ſad thing to leave all to chance, or to truſt to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary interceſſion of others; this would leave them at a great uncertainty, and, <hi>in articulo mortis,</hi> make the poor Soul ſhift its manſion in a moſt fearful apprehenſion, and horrour.

               <p>From all this now may eaſily be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the force of vitiated, and depraved Imaginations; when men's Intellectua's are firſt blinded with ignorance, and then led by Superſtition; being affrighted with uncouth relations of Apparitions, Miracles, and the horrours of an imaginary Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: what will they not do, or undertake, to alleviate, and mitigate, <hi>in tanto,</hi> if not <hi>in toto,</hi> thoſe approaching torments? and for that purpoſe, ſuffer themſelves to be haled, and pulled, ſometimes one way by guides, as blind as themſelves; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another, by treacherous, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous deſigners. Yet in the darkeſt of theſe times, there wanted not ſome, that could diſcern that all was not right, and that they were gotten into a very uncertain, and dangerous road; and in as much danger from their guides, as the enemy which they would avoid. Some of theſe, in a more ſerious way, proteſting, and adviſing both againſt the Errour, and the danger of it,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49655:117"/>had their mouths ſoon ſtopp'd; when others more jocular, between jeſt, and earneſt, as it were, made bold with the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abuſes of the times, witneſs the wits, and Satyriſts of their reſpective times <hi>Rob.</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter, John Harding, Jeffrey Chancer, John Gower, Rob. Longland,</hi> aliàs <hi>Piers Plowman, Lydgate,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, whoſe dull rimes carryed a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſence with them. Indeed though the Laſhes of a Satyriſt ſeldom or never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce amendment of Epidemical vices, and Errors; yet in this they have their fruit, that thereby poſterity is oftentimes more truly informed of the manners, and genius of times, than by the profeſſed Hiſtorian, who rarely touches that ſtring: And by theſe, the abuſes, and cheats of Prieſts, Monks, and Fryers, in their Maſſes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, Shrifts, Penances, Pardons, Indulgences, Miracles, Reliques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all ſerving to fill the people's brains with vain, and terrible apprehenſions, and to empty their purſes, were, according to the wit of their reſpective Ages, to the warning of this, notably, and ſmartly detected, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and condemned.</p>
               <p>A multitude more of inſtances might be given, of the Chargeableneſs, and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of Popery, whereby the People were daily abuſed, and improveriſhed, to the inriching of others with their ſpoils, whoſe natural office, and duty was, to feed, and not to fleece the flock. Hence
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49655:118"/>hath bin noted the ready tendency of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Religion, when it throws off its ſpiritual temper, at the ſame time to graſp at Temporal Power, and Temporal Riches. How that Power was uſurp'd, we have in part ſeen in the firſt Tract: and how the Riches were ingroſs'd, we have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make ſome diſcovery in this; and amongſt all the Arts uſed for that purpoſe, none proved more effectual, than this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Purgatory: this was the fire that alwayes kept the Pope's Kitchin warm, and gave life to Indulgences, Pardons, Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, Jubiles, Regular Foundations, Shrines, Maſſes, Confeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49655:119"/>in the one of theſe lakes the Souls were tormented with Fire, and in the other with freezing cold, and when a Soul had bin ſo long in the hot lake, that it could endure no longer, it would skip out into the cold lake; and when it had layn ſo long there, as that became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, it would leap back again into the fiery apartment: and ſo they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued continually tormented with that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternation of heat, and cold. But by all this uncertainty, or contrariety rather of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it may clearly be ſeen, upon what weak foundations they have raiſed this building; which certainly would have fallen to the ground long ago, if it had not bin for the profit which the Popes, Prieſts, and Fryers have raiſed by the ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And upon this one point of Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory, as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their Maſſes, Requiems, Dirges, Trentals, Prayers for the dead, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of merits, works of Supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Indulgences, Pardons, Jubiles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do depend; all tending to bring into the heavenly Exchequer at <hi>Rome,</hi> where, by inverſion of the Holy Scripture, <hi>Gain</hi> is great Godlineſs: and though St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Silver, and Gold have I none, yet thoſe which pretend to be his Succeſſors, ingroſs to themſelves the Treaſures of the world: for to the ſupport of that uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hierarchy, all Kings, with the People,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:49655:119"/>were by theſe Arts forced to contribute, and to make ſurrendry of their Temporal Power, and Temporal Riches: And though the Pope, as the Head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, glutted himſelf with the cream of the Kingdom's wealth; yet all the other members, down to the very petty-toes, of that Romiſh Body, would be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually raking, and ſcraping for themſelves; being as ſpunges to ſuck from the People: that they might afford ſometimes to be ſqueezed by the Pope.</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Francis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anti-mach. fo. 86, &amp;c.</note> the Founder of the Order of Franciſcan Friers, about the year 1198. amongſt other Articles of his Rule, Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus, That all that were of his Order, for Apparel, ſhould cloath themſelves with the baſeſt, vileſt, and of the loweſt price that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49655:120"/>could be: That they ſhould only have one Coat, with a Hood, and another without a Hood: That they ſhould wear no ſhoos, nor ride on Horſeback. Now amongſt the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this Order, there grew great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and diſputations, about the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of this one Article. To compoſe which, a General Chapter, or Convention was held, that the true meaning of the Article might be underſtood, and declared, and that all might ſort themſelves to one Habit, for ſome wore habits of one colour, and ſome of another: and ſome wore ſhort, and others long; inſomuch as they ſeemed not to be all of the ſame Rule, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>In this Chapter, or Convention, there were notable diſputes, and arguments, upon all the points, or branches of this Article. But about the two laſt points they came to agreement without much difficulty: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were forbidden to ride on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, they reſolv'd to ride but on Aſſes, and Mules, or to go on foot, as now commonly they do; wherein they conſidered alſo the convenience of Aſſes, in regard they could keep them in their Covents at an eaſier charge than Horſes, for they would live very well without Provender. And for Shoos, they reſolved, that they would take away the uper leather, leaving a ſole only with a thong, to go over the foot, to make the ſole faſt to the foot, and ſo they ſhould not be Shoos, but Soles. But the great difficulty was about
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49655:121"/>the Coat, and Hood: And there were ſome cunning Friers, good at diviſion, who divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the firſt branch of the Article into three principal Points or Queſtions: The Firſt, about the Colour; The Second, about the Quantity; And the Third, about the form, or faſhion of the Coat, and Hood.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt,
<note place="margin">Firſt great Point.</note> about the Colour, there were divers Opinions, and no accord could be amongſt them. For the glorious St. <hi>Francis</hi> had ſpoken nothing of the Colour in his Rule; but only ordained, that they of his Order ſhould wear Habits of a low price: and thereupon fell out a great Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> what Colour was of leaſt price, and would ſeem to be moſt vile. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                  </label> Some reaſoned thus, That the Green Colour was the cheapeſt, and vileſt; and that it was ordinarily ſeen, that people of the loweſt condition, as Carters, Mariners, and other mean people, wore that Colour in the linings of their Doublets, as the meaneſt of all; not forgetting the green Apron, generally worn by the plaineſt ſort of people, and never by the rich. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued further, that the matter wherewith the Green Colour is made, is Cheaper, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier at hand, than any other; for with Herbs, Leaves, and Graſs, the Green Colour may be made, both for Linnen, and for Wollen; Nay take a Maid, and lay her but along on the Graſs, and every one will ſay ſhe has a Green Gown.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:49655:121"/>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſ. </seg>
                  </label> But others were of Opinion, that the Murrey, or Smoky Colour, was viler, eaſier to be gotten, and cheaper, than the Green, or any other colour; for to make that colour, there need no more than to take white wool, and ſoot, and one need not go over the threſhold for materials for that dye.</p>
               <p>But then there were others of a Third Opinion, who thought themſelves more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the right, than either of the other Two; and theſe ſaid that no colour was more eaſie to be had, viler, or more ſuitable to their Order, than that which came pure from the Beaſt's back, and that was Black, or White: And that it would correſpond with St. <hi>Francis</hi> his mind, and deſign, that they ſhould wear the Colour of the Beaſt, in token of Humility, and Patience: and further adding, that all other Colours coſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if it were but labour, but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Beaſt would coſt nothing at all.</p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="Reply."/>
               <p>But to all this, they that were for Green, or Smokey Colours, replyed; That they who diſputed for the Colour of the Beaſt ſhewed they had too much of the Beaſt in them; becauſe their Concluſion was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, and indeterminative; for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded upon White, and Black, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving either upon the one, or the other; and that ſuch a Concluſion implyed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; for, ſaid they, nothing is more contrary, than Black, and White. Beſides,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:49655:122"/>if they weared the Colour of the Sheep, it might give occaſion unto men, to cenſure them for being Wolves, in Sheep's cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They urged alſo, that already other Mendicants had taken up thoſe two Colours, for the <hi>Jacobins</hi> wore White under, and Black above: and the <hi>Carmelites</hi> contrary, Black under, and White above: and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all other ſorts of Monks, which held the Rules of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> St. <hi>Benet,</hi> and others, were either Black, or White; and it might be eſteemed, either preſumption, incroachment, or uſurpation, to aſſume the Habits, or Colours of others; and therefore that would not be the way to draw unto them the Devotion of the World: And then theſe concluded, That if they ſhould take the Colour of Black, there were ſome Countreys where were no Black Sheep, as in <hi>Berry, Limoges,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc;</hi> in which Countrys they muſt be forced to dye their Wool, and that would make it dear, and, by conſequence, directly againſt the Rule of the bleſſed St. <hi>Francis;</hi> and how ſhould they pay for dying, when they are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to handle any Silver? And then, if the Order ſhould chooſe the White Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, there are other Countreys, where there are no White Sheep, or but few, as in <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> and other places; ſo that there the Friers muſt have their Cloaths out of far Countrys, which would be to their greater coſt, and directly alſo againſt their Rule, and Liberties: And therefore theſe concluded,

               <p>But then,
<note place="margin">Rejoin'd.</note> thoſe that were for the Colour of the Beaſt, rejoin'd, and ſaid, That that Opinion for Green, and that other for Smoaky Colours, were the moſt Savage, and Sordid opinions in the World, anſwerable to the Reaſon of thoſe as maintained it: for, ſaid they, Green is a Colour moſt fit for Fools, and Jackanapes's that are ordinarily ſeen in that Colour. And then, in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, where they ſay there is none but Black Wool, how can they dye that into Green, or Smoaky? But, by this time the Conteſt grew very hot, which a ſhrewd old Frier obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuſpecting that this wrangling about Habits, would bring them to a habit of wrangling, and make a rent in the Order, ſtood up, and after ſilence commanded, he commended all thoſe that had ſo throughly, and learnedly debated the matter on both ſides: but ſeeing, ſaid he, the caſe is very weighty, and difficult, it ſeems to me to merit the Reſolution of our Holy Father the Pope, and that it ought to be referred to his determination: to which motion, for that time, they all aſſented.</p>
               <p>After this,
<note place="margin">Second great Point.</note> the Seniors of the Fraternity cauſed the ſecond Queſtion of the three to be propoſed, touching the quantity of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, whether they ſhould be long, or ſhort; wide, or ſtrait. And to this, a number ſtood up, declaring their Opinion to be, That the Garments of their Order ought to be ſhort,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49655:123"/>and ſtrait, and that for many reaſons, as they alledged:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                  </label> For, ſaid they, Garments that are ſhort, and ſtrait, are more vile, and better cheap, than ſuch are, that be long, and large, becauſe they have not ſo much ſtuff in them: Therefore, ſince the Glorious St. <hi>Francis,</hi> our Founder, ordained we ſhould wear Habits vile, and of little price, we cannot better obſerve that Holy Rule, (wherein conſiſteth the eſtate of perfection) than in making our Habits as ſhort, and ſtrait as is poſſible. Beſides, ſaid they, our bleſſed Founder hath made us all Mendicants, to live on the Charities of good people, to gather which, we muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways travelling, and running about the Country; and therefore we cannot poſſibly be ſo nimble, in a long, and wide, as in a ſhort, and ſtrait garment.</p>
               <p>But then preſently another company ſteps up,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> and condemns this Opinion, as the moſt ſtrange, and ridiculous as might be: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaid theſe, if Friers ſhould wear ſhort Habits, they would look more like Jockeys, and Millers, than Friers: and experience ſhews, that in ſome Countrys, where Friers uſed to wear ſhort Habits, the Order was preſently contemned, and derided, and men call'd them curtail'd Friers. Beſides, the very mind of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> in this, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what be underſtood, becauſe in this Article he uſes the word Tunic, which ſeems to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a long Robe, or Garment. Moreover, long habits are more ſeemly for religious men,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49655:123"/>and ſhort Habits for Lay-men. Further they ſaid that all other ſorts of Monks wore long, and wide Habits, and it would be a great blemiſh, as well as a Novelty, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the moſt glorious St. <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould take a ſhort Habit. And then, ſaid they, when we go into the Pulpit to Preach, or when we go to ſay Maſs, will it not be a rare ſight for us to go like Skipjacks, and Millers? Therefore theſe concluded, that their Habit ſhould be long, and large.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reply. </seg>
                  </label> the firſt Opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in this point Replyed, and ſaid, That the good St. <hi>Francis</hi> had taught them the way of Humility, and therefore they ſhould not wear long Garments, like Phariſees, to be reverenced in the World; for that taſted of Pride, and not of his Humility; and they which are deſpiſed of the world, are eſteemed of God, and ſo contrary. Then for the Notation of the word Tunic, they ſaid, that in the Rule of S. <hi>Benet,</hi> it ſignified not a long Robe, but a little Coat, or Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock, and ſo it is found in <hi>Ambroſe Calepin</hi>'s Dictionary (who was of our Order, ſaid they,) not a long Robe, but <hi>Toga,</hi> and that therefore the Letter of the Article made for them in that point. And as for what had been ſaid, that other Monks wear long, and wide; theſe ſaid it would be ſo much the better, that there might be a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and others; and that they might not look like Lay-men in ſhort Habits, the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49655:124"/>Hood would make a difference ſufficient for that purpoſe: and length of Garments alone would not diſtinguiſh them from the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people, for many of them alſo wore long Robes, as Advocates, Councellors, Proctors, Phyſitians, and Merchants, and divers others: And though we may confeſs, ſaid they, that at the beginning, it poſſibly may ſeem a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, to wear ſhort, and ſtrait Garments, with a Hood; but time, and cuſtom will take away the ſtrangeneſs of it, for to all things there is a beginning. But, by this time the diſputes upon theſe points began to be very warm alſo: ſo that ſome of the old ſubtile Friers commanded ſilence again; and having given due commendations to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and nimbleneſs of the Diſputers on both ſides, they Reſolved to remit the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of theſe high matters alſo to the great Oracle of the World, their H. Father at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Third Queſtion was ſtarted,
<note place="margin">Third great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</note> touching the form, and faſhion of theſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits: and upon that it was put to the Cue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Whether their Habits ſhould be ſingle, or double: If they might be any whit fine, or not: If they ſhould have Collers, or none: If they ſhould uſe Points, or But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons: If they ſhould have skirts, or none: Or ſleeves, or no ſleeves: Or, if ſleeves, whether the hanging ſleeves,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                  </label> or no: And upon this matter of ſleeves, ſome were for little ſleeves, becauſe the great ones would take up more ſtuff, and be dearer, and ſo
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49655:124"/>contrary to their Rule:
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> But then others that were for the great ſleeves, ſaid, they might ſerve them in ſtead of a ſcrip, or pouch; for the good St. <hi>Francis</hi> had commanded them to beg, and live upon Alms, and alſo had forbidden them to carry pouch, bag, or ſcrip, and it was neceſſary they ſhould have ſomething wherein to put their Alms. To Anſwer which, the others ſaid there might be another help, <hi>viz.</hi> to take a Man, or a Boy with them, (whom they might call a <hi>Judas</hi>) to carry a bag, or ſcrip, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who alſo might take mony, if any gave it. But this project did not, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, pleaſe the others; though as to the taking of money, they liked that well enough, but ſuch Boyes, and Men would be <hi>Judas's</hi> indeed, and ſteal, and purloin what was given; however if they ſhould be honeſt, they muſt be maintained, which would ſtrike a great ſtroke, and make a hole in their gains, and ſo the bread would be eaten out of the poor Fryer's mouths by theſe hang-by's.</p>
               <p>Then they came to debate the faſhion of their Hoods: And as to that,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>
                  </label> ſome were for flat, and cloſe Hoods, which they ſaid would betoken Humility; and would be warmer: But others were for the ſharp pointed Hood,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> which they ſaid would denote their ſharp, quick, and piercing Conceits, and how they aſpired upwards. And many allegations, and exceptions were made, and taken to all theſe, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49655:125"/>divers other the like points, which blew the Company into a great Combuſtion: which ſome of the more diſcreet amongſt them perceiving, and conſidering what bad ſucceſs they had in the diſputes upon the former Points, and that in theſe there was like to be no better harmony: they moved that the differences in theſe great Points alſo might be referred to the infallible Judgement of the Pope, holding it as expedient to ſend for a reſolution of three Queſtions, as of two; for ſaid they, when a fire is made, it is as cheap roaſting Three Chickens, as Two. And to this they all conſented.</p>
               <p>Not long after, certain Delegates of the Order took their Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> to Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Third, about the year 1280. who convened all his Cardinals, that with them he might underſtand, and determine all theſe high, and ſubtile Points. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long debate, and mature deliberation taken, upon all things alledged, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, in theſe matters; at length, with the advice of his Cardinals, the Pope made this Reſolution, <hi>viz.</hi> He ordained, and commanded, that in all thoſe Queſtions, that only ſhould be obſerved, which ſhould be concluded and determined in a Chapiter General, or elſe in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Chapiters, or Conventions, which for that purpoſe ſhould be Congregated: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that there might alwayes ſhine in the Fryers an holy Poverty, according to their holy Rule. Upon this, and for this
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49655:125"/>purpoſe, many Chapiters were afterwards aſſembled: but all to no purpoſe at all, for therein they fell out, in as great heats, and differences, about all theſe difficult points, as ever they were before.</p>
               <p>Then, about thirty years after, the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, by reaſon of the great diſſentions amongſt them, touching theſe matters, ſent Delegates to <hi>Rome</hi> again, to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, who then held a Council at <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, An. D.</hi> 1311. giving the Pope to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, How, according to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the Chapters had done all they poſſibly could, to overcome the ſaid difficulties, but could not bring them to any tolerable concluſion; but that contrarily, the more the matters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, the more doubts, and difficulties al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes did ariſe: therefore, as to the very Oracle of Truth, they wholly ſubmitted to him all their differences in the premiſes. Upon this the Pope, after hearing all that they alledg'd, and offered, touching the points in difference, with advice of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Cardinals, Doctors, and others aſſembled in that Council, puts forth a true Oracle indeed, that is, nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty to the Queſtions propos'd to him: For his Reſolution was, That the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and the other chief Miniſters of the Order, ſhould judge of the vility, colour, length, wideneſs, and faſhion of their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits: Commanding all the Fryers punctually to obſerve, and obey the Orders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49655:126"/>of their Guardians, and Chiefs, without framing, or propoſing any more doubts, ſubtilties, or ſcruples. With all this, contained in a very fair Bull, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, and Agents returned home: And the Guardians, and Chiefs of the Order, in purſuance thereof, applyed themſelves to order, and ſettle theſe matters: But then, beſides the differences that aroſe amongſt themſelves, when ever they agreed on any thing, thoſe Fryers, againſt whoſe Opinion it was carryed, would quarrel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently at it, and would be ſo far from yielding conformity, that they did not ſpare to revile their Superiours, calling them Fools, and Dunces, for no better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Text of St. <hi>Francis</hi> his Rule: And in this diſorder they continued a long time; untill</p>
               <p>In the year 1323. in the time of Pope <hi>John</hi> the 22. who reſided at <hi>Avignion,</hi> the Guardians, and ſuperiours of the Order went to complain once more to his Holineſs, that the Fryers would not obey the Orders they had agreed upon by vertue of the Bull of Pope <hi>Clement;</hi> and humbly prayed his Holineſs further directions, and aid therein. Whereupon the Pope ſent Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to all thoſe Fryers who refuſed to obey their Superior's Decrees in all thoſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted points, that they ſhould either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, or by writing certifie the Reaſons of their obſtinacy: and when theſe were come in, the Pope aſſembled all his Cardinals in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49655:126"/>Conclave, where the Allegations for, and againſt the Fryer's diſobedience, were all canvaſſed, and debated at large, and many offers, and propoſals made for a final con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all: but nothing of that nature was accepted, and no agreement there was like to be except, the Pope would juridically, and openly, and plainly give his Sentence in the caſe. And thereupon the Pope gave Order for his definitive Bull to be drawn up: wherein, in the firſt place, he highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled the Bulls of his Predeceſſors, the Popes <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> wondring why men ſhould decline the import, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enor of them: and then for himſelf, he ordained, and declared, That the vilitie of Habits ſhould be meaſured by the cuſtom of every Country: and after gave power, and Commiſſion to the Guardians, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors of the Order (as did Pope <hi>Clement</hi>) to make a Rule for the longitude, latitude, colour, thickneſs, faſhion, ſubſtance, and vility, as well of the <hi>Tunics,</hi> as the Hood; and upon all other circumſtances, accidents, and dependances upon the ſame: command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Fryers to obey the Rules that ſhould be made, without any more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, Arguments, or Contradictions. But neither would this Third Bull do the buſineſs; for men eſteemed it, in effect, no more than what had bin order'd before, without any fruit. And ſo the heats, and diſputes continued amongſt the Fryers, as high as ever: Nay ſome ſpared not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49655:127"/>on the Pope himſelf, ſaying, that he did not rightly underſtand the points in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: Others, that he uſed too many Councellors, and that one honeſt <hi>Tailor,</hi> if the Pope could have found him, would better have inform'd how to ſtitch up theſe rents, than the whole Conclave: and the greateſt Scandal was, that if the Pope, the <hi>Vice-deus,</hi> the Oracle of Truth, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Head, the infallible Guide, could not ſettle, and put an end to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of ſuch inferiour nature; how could he (did many ſay) infallibly judge, and determine in matters of Faith, and the more ſublime points of Religion, about which there were ſuch differences in the world?</p>
               <p>But at laſt theſe heats amongſt the Fryers were ſomewhat allayed, and cool'd with time: and the generality of the Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took thmeſelves to the White, and Black Colours, as they come purely from the Beaſt, and thence the denomination to the white, and black Fryers: and ſome of them intermingled the two Colours, and made a third, and from them came the Grey Fryers. And for the Garments, and Hoods, they came to wear them long, and large: only the difference about the Sleeves was never yet accorded, for ſome wear ſtrait, and little Sleeves; and others wear large, and wide, for ſome conveniences, and of this ſort was that Fryer, who when he was Preaching againſt ſtealing, had all the time a Gooſe in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49655:127"/>his Sleeve. And thus, though their Infallible Judge could not, or would not, put an end to theſe differences amongſt his own Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with all his <hi>Decretals,</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants,</hi> as thoſe Bulls were called; yet at this time we ſhall here to them all put a</p>

            <head>An Eſſay of the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the King of <hi>England,</hi> within his Majeſty's Realms, and Dominions.</head>
            <p>IN our view of the reſplendent Majeſty of our Soveraign Lord, the King of <hi>England,</hi> it muſt needs fare with us, as with a curious eye, that looks on the Sun in its full luſter; thereby diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering its own weakneſs, ſooner than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Glorious Body: being dazell'd, if it gaze too long; and ſcorched,
<note place="margin">Excellens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruit ſenſum.</note> if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach too near ſuch a refulgent, and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd Object. And therefore, that I may proceed with Truth, and ſafety, in this affair, I muſt make uſe of the Inſtruments of Law, and the skreen of Authorities, to direct, and defend me, in my intended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs therein.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place therefore, we are to know, That the King of <hi>England</hi> hath two capacities in him: <hi>viz.</hi> One as a natural Body, being deſcended of the Blood Royal of this Realm: and this Body is of the ſame
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49655:129"/>nature with his Subjects,
<note place="margin">Plowd. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. ſeig. Barkly's Caſe. fo. 234. Id. Caſe de Duchy. fo. 213.</note> and ſubject to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, Death, and the like. The other as a Politick Body, or Capacity; ſo called, becauſe it is framed by the Policy of man: and in this Capacity the King is eſteemed to be Immortal, not ſubject to Infirmity, Death, Nonage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, when a King of <hi>England</hi> dyes, the Lawyers have a peculiar way of expreſſing the ſame, not ſaying the Death of the King, but the King's demiſe.
<note place="margin">Demiſe le Roy.</note> And therefore, in reſpect of this Politick Capacity, it is often ſaid, That the King of <hi>England</hi> never dyes: and by the Law of <hi>England</hi> there can be no <hi>Interregnum;</hi> for upon the King's <hi>Demiſe,</hi> his lawful Succeſſor is, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> King, without any eſſential Ceremony, or Act, <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> to be done: For the coronation is but a Royal ornament,
<note place="margin">Calvin's Caſe. fo. 10, 11.</note> and ſolemnization of the Royal Deſcent, but no part of the Title. And all this may be collected from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of all the Judges, in the caſe of <hi>Watſon,</hi> and <hi>Clark, Seminary</hi> Prieſts, who, with others,
<note place="margin">Hill. An. 1 Jac. Cok. Pl. Coron. 7.</note> entered into Treaſon againſt King <hi>James,</hi> before his coronation. So King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, was not crowned untill the eighth year of his Raign, and yet ſeveral men, before his Coronation, were Attaint of Treaſon, and Felony, as by the Records thereof it doth appear.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons, and cauſes, wherefore, by the Policy of the Law, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is thus a Body Politick, are three. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Cauſa Maſeſtatis,</hi> The King
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49655:129"/>cannot give, or take,
<note place="margin">Calvin's Caſe. fo. 12.</note> but by matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: and that in regard of the Dignity of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Cauſa Neceſſitatis;</hi> as in caſe to avoyd the Attainder of him that hath Right to the Crown: As if the right Heir to the Crown be Attaint of High Treaſon, yet ſhall the Crown deſcend to him, and, <hi>eo inſtanti,</hi> when it happens, without any other reverſal, the Attainder is purged; as it fell out in the Caſe of King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. leſt, in the <hi>interim,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Hen. 7. fo. 4. b.</note> there ſhould be an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum,</hi> which the Law of <hi>England</hi> will not ſuffer, any more than nature doth a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> As alſo by vertue of this Politick Capacity, though the King be within Age, yet he may make Leaſes, and Grants; and the ſame ſhall be valid: for otherwiſe his revenue would decay; and the King would not be able to reward ſervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Cauſa <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitatis;</hi> As when Lands, and Tenements, or Poſſeſſions deſcend from his collateral Anceſtors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects, as ſuppoſe from the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> &amp;c. to the King; the King is ſeiſed, or poſſeſſed of them, <hi>jure Coronae,</hi> in his Politick Capacity, and they ſhall go with the Crown. And in this Capacity it was, that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had, and injoyed all that belonged to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> though they were but Siſters of the half Blood, which no others could do. And as the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is Deſcendible to the Heirs males, yet when a King dies, and leaves no Son,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49655:130"/>but Daughters only, the Crown, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Royal, deſcends to the Kings eldeſt Daughter alone, and to her Poſterity: and ſo it hath bin declared by a Parliament: for <hi>Regnum non eſt diviſibile.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Stat. 25 Hen. 8. cap. 22.</note> And there ſhall be no <hi>Poſſeſſio fratris</hi> of the Lands of the Crown: for the quality of the Perſon doth in theſe, and many other likes caſes, alter the deſcent. So as all the Lands, and Poſſeſſions, whereof the King is ſeiſed, or poſſeſſed, <hi>jure coronae,</hi> ſhall attend upon and follow the Crown, unto whomſoever it ſhall Deſcend: for the Crown, and the Poſſeſſions of the ſame, are <hi>concomitantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The naturall Body of the King being thus inveſted with his Politick, and Royal Capacity, we behold him as the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and Lieutenant of God Almighty, who is King of Kings. All Power is from God; and <hi>Imperium non niſi Divino fato datur:</hi> And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> did ſay, That God did not appoint, and eſtabliſh men, that is, men of a common ſort, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, and purely Humane, to rule and govern others, (cautiouſly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) but ſuch as by ſome Divine touch, ſingular vertue, and gift of Heaven, do excel others: and therefore they are called <hi>Heroes,</hi> and ſtand in Compariſon with others, as we may conceive of the Air, which if we do compare with the Heavens, it is a kind of Earth: but if we compare it with the Earth, it is then a kind of Heaven. So of King's, if we compare them with God
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49655:130"/>Almighty, they are but a kind of men; but if we compare them with other men, they are a kind of gods: both intimated in that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have ſaid ye are gods, but ye ſhall dye like men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Royal majeſty of the King of <hi>England</hi> is repleniſhed with plenary, and undoubted Right, and Authority to rule, and govern all his Subjects; and that in all Cauſes, as well Eccleſiaſtical, as Temporal. For this Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> is a Soveraign Empire or Monarchy conſiſting of one Head; the Soveraign, or King; and of a Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, the People: and this Body is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into the Clergy, and the Laity: all of them intirely Subject to their Royal Head, the King: who, as before is ſaid, is furniſhed, and inſtituted with an intire Authority over every Subject, of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or quality ſoever: and that in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and Temporal: For otherwiſe the King would be imperfect in his Authority, contrary to the true notion of Soveraignty; and thereby diſabled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Juſtice in all cauſes, to all his Subjects, or to puniſh all crimes, and offences within his Dominions: a conſideration of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, for the neceſſary ſecurity both of Prince, and People.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the full, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Right of the King, to rule and govern all his Subjects, and that in all cauſes: and conſequently the juſt, and neceſſary duty of all his Subjects to yield a full, and intire
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49655:131"/>Obedience to all the Kings good Laws: (for it is the Law that meaſures out, and ſpiriteth the King's Authority; as it directs, and enforces the Subject's Obedience) yet ſo it hath bin, and ſo it is, in our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian times, partly by the obſtinacy, and devotedneſs of ſome; the weakneſs, and ignorance of others; and the peeviſhneſs, and perverſneſs of many; that there is a multitude of natural born Subjects in this Kingdom, who, in defiance of the Laws, both in their Opinions, and Practices, deny, or oppoſe our Soveraigns Supremacy.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, there are the Sectaries; who, notwithſtanding the Law is the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of true Allegiance, make the ground, the rule, and meaſures of their Allegiance, to be their own private fancies: And though the Law is the bright Sun, ſhining in the Horizon of this Kingdom, by the Light whereof every one ought to guide his actions; yet theſe men out-ſtare this Sun, and giddily run, ſome of them after the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of a pretended Light within them: ſome after the falſe fires of a miſguided zeal: too many after the <hi>Boutfeaus</hi> or male-content Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries: and ſome after the very fumes of Hypochondriacal fits, miſtaken for viſions, and Revelations.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, there are the <hi>Devoto's</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> who in contempt of the King's Laws, and Authority, make the rules, and meaſures of their Allegiance to be the will, and pleaſure of a Forrainer. As the Sectaries
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49655:131"/>ſet up a Pope in every man's Conſcience, (whilſt they inveſt it with a power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol the Decrees of Princes) and new Lights for themſelves to live, and walk by; theſe, contrarily, put out their own Eyes, and give themſelves up to be led by an infallible Head, as they think; to whom whilſt they yield a blind Obedience, they cannot ſee to be good Subjects. Theſe men, of both ſorts, ſtrike at our Supremacy, the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and heart-ſtring of Government; and by whom the very Sinews of Soveraignty are cut aſunder; when either upon the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of fanatical deluſions, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious awes of an extraneous Power, the King's natural Subjects ſhall audaciouſly lift up their Hands, and Heels againſt him.</p>
            <p>My Province, at this time, to wave all diſputes, ſhall only be to make ſome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe Foundations of Law, Right, and Authority, whereon our King's Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy is built, by the Legal, and unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Hiſtorical Evidences, and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto's of the ſame: and whilſt I keep cloſe there, I ſhall be ſure to be on a ſafe bottom. I ſhall not pretend to wade into the vaſt Ocean of the King's Prerogative, in all its exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but ſhall confine my ſelf to the affair of the King's Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical matters; without profeſſing yet a ſtature to reach the top of this ſublime, or the bottom of this profound concern.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then, we are to know, that the King's juſt, and lawful Authority
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49655:132"/>in Eccleſiaſtical matters, is in part declared by a ſtatute made in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>

But for our purpoſe, it will be ſufficient to tranſcribe the Preamble of the Act; which runs thus: Moſt humbly beſeech your moſt excellent Majeſty, your faithful and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal, and the Commons in this your preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſembled, that where in time of the raign of your moſt dear Father of worthy memory King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. divers good Laws, and Statutes were made, as well for the better extinguiſhment and putting away of all uſurped and forrain powers, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities out of this your Realm, and other your Highneſs Dominions and Countrys, as alſo for the

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49655:132"/>uſurped, until ſuch time as all the ſaid good laws, and Statutes by one Act of Parliament made in the firſt and ſecond years of the raigns of the late King <hi>Philip,</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> your Highneſs Siſter, Intituled, An Act repealing all Statutes, Articles, and Proviſions made againſt the See Apoſtolick of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the 20th. year of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and alſo for the eſtabliſhment of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Eccleſiaſtical poſſeſſions and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditaments conveyed to the Laity, were all clearly repealed and made void: as by the ſame Act of repeal more at large appears. By reaſon of which Act of repeal, your ſaid humble Subjects were eſt-ſoons brought again under an uſurped forrain power and authority, and yet do remain in that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to the intolerable charges of your loving Subjects, if ſome redreſs (by the Authority of this your High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with the aſſent of your Highneſs) be not had and provided.

            <p>Nor is this Authority united to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> only, but of right alſo to all other Chriſtian Crowns; and accordingly avowed by all other Chriſtian Princes.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49655:134"/>to give unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> as to God, the things that are God's. But for the matter of practice; And in the firſt place here I cannot but take notice, That in the firſt Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Religion did not only ſubſiſt, but ſpread by immediate influence from Heaven only; but when by vertue of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it had once prevailed, and triumphed over all oppoſitions of <hi>Pagan</hi> ſuperſtition, and perſecution, and ſubdued the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours themſelves, and became the Imperial Religion; then Eccleſiaſtical Authority aſſumed, and fixed it ſelf in its natural and proper place; and the excerciſe of its Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction (and what that was I ſhall ſhew alſo) was reſtored to the Imperial <hi>Diadem:</hi> and <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was no ſooner ſetled in his Imperial Throne, but he took the ſettlement of all Eccleſiaſtical matters into his care and cogniſans: He call'd <hi>Synods,</hi> and Councils, and ratified their Canons into Laws: He routed the Conventicles of the Donatiſts: made Edicts concerning Feſtivals, the Rites of Sepulture, the immunities of Churches, the Authority of Biſhops, the Priviledges of the Clergy, with divers other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the outward Politie of the Church: In which affair he was carefully followed by his Succeſſors, as evidently may appear to all converſant in the Civil Law. And the aforeſaid <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> in that his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Oration of true Obedience, makes inſtance in the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi>

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49655:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>that made thoſe Laws, and the Judges that did interpret them, did for the moſt part follow the ſame Opinions in Religion, which were held, and taught in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore thoſe that will lay upon this Nation the imputation of Schiſm, for denying the Pope's Supremacy here,
<note place="margin">Vid. Caſe de Premunire: in St. John Davys Rep.</note> muſt charge it many Ages before the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, For the Kings, Lords, and Commons of this Realm, have ever been moſt eminent for aſſerting their juſt Rights, and Liberties; diſdaining to become a Tributary Province, as it were, to the See of <hi>Rome;</hi> or part of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s earthly Patrimony in <hi>Demeſn.</hi> And the Faith, and Loyalty of the Engliſh race hath bin generally ſuch, (though true it is, that every Age hath brought forth ſome ſingular monſters of diſloyalty) as no pretence of zeal, or Religion could ever draw the greater part of the Subjects for to ſubmit themſelves to a forrain Yoke; no not when Popery was in greateſt height, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; of all which the aforeſaid Statutes are manifeſt Evidences, being generally made at the Prayer of the Commons, as by their Preambles may appear, moſt worthy to be read: Particularly, in the Preamble to the Statute of 16 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. They complain,
<note place="margin">Sta. 16 Ric. 2. cap. 5.</note> That by Bulls, and Proceſſes from <hi>Rome,</hi> the King is deprived of that Juriſdiction which belongs of right to his Imperial Crown: That the King doth loſe the ſervice, and Counſel of his Prelates, and learned men
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49655:144"/>by tranſlations made by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the King's Laws are defeated at his will, the Treaſure of the Realm is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and exported to inrich his Court: And that by thoſe means the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which hath ever bin free, and ſubject unto none, but immediately unto God, ſhould be ſubmitted unto the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the utter deſtruction of the King; and the whole Realm, which God defend, ſay they: and thereupon out of their zeal, and loyalty, they offer to live, and dye with the King, in defence of the liberties of the Crown: And then they pray the King to examine all the Lords in Parliament, what they thought of theſe wrongs, and uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whether they would ſtand with the King in defence of his Royal liberties; which being done, the Lords Spiritual, and Temporal, did all anſwer that theſe uſurpations of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> were againſt the liberties of the Crown, and that they were all bound by their Allegiance to ſtand with the King, and to maintain his Honour, and Prerogative.</p>
            <p>Upon producing, and averrement of all this, it is requiſite ſome ſatisfaction be given about the concluſion, that hapned ſo different to theſe premiſes. For, if the Kings, and People of <hi>England</hi> have in all times been ſo ſenſible of, and zealous for their juſt Rights, how could the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, in derogation of thoſe Rights, arrive to ſuch a conſiſtence, and height, as here it was for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49655:144"/>many years? To this, as to the means, and manner of that acquiſt, to keep within our Hiſtorical compaſs; Firſt let it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, as undoubtedly true, That before the time of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had very little, or nothing to do here, as well in matter of Fact, as of Right: For before that time the Pope's Writ did not run in <hi>England:</hi> His Bulls of Excommunication, and Proviſion came not hither: no Citations, or Appeals were made from hence to the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> Our Archbiſhops did not purchaſe their Palls there: Neither had the Pope the Inveſtiture of any of our Biſhopricks: And <hi>Ingulphus,</hi> who lived in the Conquerours time, a Favourite, and one preferred by him, thus informs,

But for our purpoſe, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> had any Juriſdiction, or Hierarchical Authority in the times of the <hi>Brittains, Saxons,</hi> or <hi>Danes,</hi> there is an <hi>altum ſilentium</hi> in all

And though the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror did thus Complement the Pope, in the admiſſion of his Legates, and ſome other ſmall matters, yet how far he really ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf appears by an Epiſtle to <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh, by him wrote, thus, <hi>Excellentiſſimo S.

            <p>When the Laity had ſwallowed this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Faſting, then, <hi>De una praeſumptione ad aliam tranſivit Romanus Pontifex,</hi> as <hi>Marſil.

<note place="margin">An. 14 Hen 3. Mat.

            <p>But then we muſt know, that theſe <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> ſo made, were not intirely, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely receiv'd in all parts of Chriſtendom, but only, at firſt, in the Temporal Territory of the Pope, which, on that account, is call'd by the Canoniſts, <hi>Patria Obedientiae,</hi> but wholly rejected in <hi>England, France,</hi> and other Chriſtian Countreys, which thence are ſometimes called <hi>Patriae conſuetudinariae,</hi> as reſolving to adhere to their old Laws, and Cuſtoms: As the Canon that prohibits Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Benefices <hi>per Laicam manum,</hi> was always diſobeyed in <hi>England, France,</hi> the Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> and divers other Countrys. The Canon to legitimate Infants born before

The Canon that exempted Clerks from the Secular Power was never obſerved fully in any part of Chriſtendom: Infallible arguments, that theſe Canons received not the force of Laws from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as if that had power to give Laws to all Nations without their reſpective conſents; but the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and uſage of the People received them as they pleaſed, partially, and ſpecially, as to Places, Times, and parts of thoſe Canons; and for the ſame reaſon that ſome rejected one, others did more, and ſome all of them; as <hi>Bodin</hi> ſays,

            <p>Now when the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> perceived that many of his Canons were embraced in ſeveral Countreys; under colour thereof he claim'd Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction within thoſe Realms, with power to interpret, and diſpence with his own Canons; and for that purpoſe ſent his Legates about, with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to hear and determine cauſes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe Laws; which, upon their firſt exhibition,

<note place="margin">An Dom. 1297 Tho.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49655:150"/>to the Statute of Faculties,
<note place="margin">Stat. 25 Hen. 8. cap. 21.</note> and Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made in the raign of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. to which the Reader is referred.</p>
            <p>As another Branch of the Pope's power, in the matters aforeſaid, we may obſerve that this clauſe, or words <hi>(non obſtante)</hi> was firſt invented, and uſed in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereupon <hi>Marſil.

<note place="margin">Vid. le Caſe de Penal. ſtat. in Coke 7.

<note place="margin">Mat. Paris in An. 1245.</note> ſays thus, <hi>Sed omnia haec, &amp; alia per hoc repagulum, non obſtante, infirmantur.</hi> But now to return.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen how by ſeveral ſteps, and gradations it was, after the Norman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> uſurp'd upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> in four main points of Juriſdiction, under four of our Kings, (not immediately ſucceeding, for of King <hi>Will. Rufus</hi> the Pope could gain nothing:) <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Upon the Conquerour, by ſending Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, or Commiſſioners, to hear, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49655:150"/>Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, and other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. 2. Upon King <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Inveſtiture of Biſhopricks, and other Benefices. 3. Upon King <hi>Stephen,</hi> in drawing of Appeals to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> 4. Upon King <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. in the exemption of Clerks from the ſecular Power: all rivetted, and clinch'd by the new Decrees, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, which were continually multiplyed, and obtruded here; and all this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the generous reſiſtances, which, at ſeveral times, were made to all.</p>
            <p>Neither would all this ſatisfie, till an entire ſurrender of the Crown it ſelf was obtain'd from King <hi>John,</hi> re-granted him again, to hold in <hi>Fee-Farm</hi> and <hi>Vaſſallage</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> For it was both before, in, and after this King's time, that by the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and activity of ſtrangers, and treachery, or puſillanimity of ſubjects, co-operating with the weakneſſes, and neceſſities of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Papacy arrived to that height, as to domineer in a moſt intolerable way, both over the Purſe, the Conſcience, the Regality, and all the moſt weighty concernments of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Now, to redreſs all this, ſome unequal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances were at divers times made:
<note place="margin">Vid. Mat. Paris in H. 3. in toto.</note> King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. was totally born down, and his Kingdom, and ſubjects reduced to utter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and ſlavery by this uſurpation.</p>
            <p>After him comes the noble King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. who truly may be ſtiled <hi>Vindex Libertatis Anglicanae:</hi> at his Father's death he was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49655:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>abroad in the Holy Land; but no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and Crown'd, and finding his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in ſuch a bad plight, his firſt work was to put ſome ſtop to the career of Papal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments: For the Pope having then ſummoned a General Council, he would not ſuffer his Biſhops to repair to it, till he took a ſolemn Oath of them for their Loyalty, and good abearing: Then the Pope forbidding the King to War againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> he ſlights his prohibition, and proceeds: The Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Firſt Fruits of Eccleſiaſtical Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but the King forbids the payment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to him: The Pope ſends forth a general Bull, prohibiting the Clergy to pay Subſidies to Temporal Princes, whereupon, a Tenth being granted to the King in Parliament, the Clergy refuſed to pay it; but the King ſeiſeth their Temporalties for the Contempt, and obtained payment, notwithſtanding the Pope's Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ain,</hi> that the Church might not grow monſtrous in temporal poſſeſſions: In his time, one of his ſubjects brougth in a Bull of Excommunication againſt another, and the King Commanded he ſhould be executed as a Traitor, according to the ancient law; but the Chancellor, and Treaſurer, on their knees begged that he ſhould be only baniſhed: He cauſed Laws to be made againſt bringing in of Bulls of Proviſion, and <hi>Breves</hi> of Citation, and made the firſt Statute againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors.</p>
            <pb n="271" facs="tcp:49655:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>His Succeſſor King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. being but a weak Prince, ſuffered the Pope to grow upon him, but then the Peers, and People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him all they could, and when that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy King was to be depos'd, amongſt the Articles fram'd againſt him, one of the moſt hainous was, <hi>That he had given allowance to the Pope's Bulls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. a magnanimous Prince, couragiouſly reſiſted the Pope's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, and cauſed the Statutes againſt Proviſors to be ſeverely put in execution, and the Biſhops of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Waltham</hi> convicted, and puniſhed for their high contempts. Yet during the nonage of King <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. the Pope's Bulls,
<note place="margin">Stat. 16 R. 2. ca. 5.</note> Breves, and Legats became very buſie, and daring again, whereof the People became ſo ſenſible, and impatient, that upon their ſpecial prayer the <hi>Stat.</hi> 16. <hi>R.</hi> 2. of <hi>Praemunire</hi> was enacted, more ſevere, and penal than all the former Statutes againſt Proviſors: and yet againſt this King, as againſt King <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. it was objected, at the time of his depoſe, that he had allowed the Pope's Bulls, to the enthralling of the Crown.</p>
            <p>After this comes a weak King, <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. and then another attempt was made, if poſſible, to revive the uſurped Juriſdiction; for the commons denying the King money, when he was in great wants, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the reſt of the Biſhops, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the King a large ſupply, if that he would conſent, that all the Laws againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:49655:152"/>and eſpecially that of 16 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. might be repealed; but the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who before had burnt the Pope's Letters, cauſed this motion to be rejected; ſo that all thoſe Laws, by eſpecial providence, have ſtood in force untill this day. All which, with the Reſolutions, and Judicial Judgements before ſpecified, founded upon the ancient, and good Laws of the Land, have enabled our Kings, at all times ſince, to vindicate the juſt Rights of their Crown.

            <p>Beſides theſe which have been experienc'd in our own Country, infinite have been the miſchiefs, occaſion'd in the World, upon this ſcore of Supremacy, and Dominion: and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:49655:154"/>that by the mighty ſtrugling, and bickerings that have been maintained between the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and the Princes of the Earth, about the gaining, and keeping this Power.

Alſo the decay, and corruption of ſincere piety, and devotion, by the turning the current of Religion, out of its pure pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive channel, into the ſink of diſputes, and controverſies, about the Rights, and Bounds of Dominion; when Chriſt himſelf hath told us, <hi>That his Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> This cauſed Divine Religion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Humane Policy: and upon this it was, that <hi>Machiavel,</hi> too truly, obſerved,

            <p>And for this main drift of the Papacy for Dominion in all places, but now mentioned; it is viſible, that the Pope's Supremacy is the foundation that ſupports the whole building of that Hierarchy; and therefore it hath been thought neceſſary by them always to lay that ſtone in the firſt place: As about the year 1594. the Biſhops of <hi>South Ruſſia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> but of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, ſubmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49655:155"/>chief ſtruggle, and deſign was for Temporal Greatneſs; that many concluſions tending to that end, were obtruded as Articles of Faith, ſo manifeſtly contrary to the Dictates of Chriſtianity, and prejudicial to the Rights of others: Then both Princes, and People, began to look into their Title, and examine their Evidences, and finding them all defective, and defeaſible, thought there was no other remedy, but quite to cut off that Power, that would not be confin'd: whereby this Image of Papal Supremacy became broken, and thrown down in many Countreys, and is but in a tottering condition in ſeveral others at this day: The Kings, and Princes of the Earth maintaining the juſt Rights of their Crowns, and Kingdoms againſt this Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on theſe, and the like grounds, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Title, and Power of Kings is far more ancient than this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Spiritual Dominion, and <hi>Quod prius eſt tempore, potius eſt jure:</hi> and that in this ſence Grace deſtroyeth not nature; and Kings muſt not loſe by becoming Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. That Dominion is expreſly given in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture unto Kings, and is as expreſly denyed in Scripture unto the Clergy. That as the Pope claimeth, at beſt, to be but the Vicar of Chriſt, and that not as he was God; it is moſt certain that Chriſt never impeach'd, impair'd, or impos'd upon the Temporal Right of any man; the ſame Authority that Princes had, either by the Law of Nature, or of Nations, before his coming, the ſame

            <p>But now, for a Concluſion of this Diſcourſe,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49655:156"/>touching the Kings Supremacy, it will be but pertinent, and reaſonably expected, to clear one thing. <hi>viz.</hi> whereas upon reſtitution of that Right to the Crown, by the Statute made in the Firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſome were induced to conceive, by the generality of the words, that affirm her Majeſty to be Supream Governor, as well in all Spiritual, or Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, as Temporal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if it had bin an uſurping upon the Sacred function of the Church, properly belonging to them in Sacred Orders. To give ſatisfaction in this, we may, in the firſt place, obſerve, in what Sphears, and in what diſtances, all the Divines agree that Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority doth move; and for our purpoſe at this time, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhall ſuffice for all;
<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Rom. Pont. li. 4. c. 22. ſ. 1.</note> who divides Spiritual Power, into that of <hi>Ordinis,</hi> and that of <hi>Juriſdictionis:</hi> For that of <hi>Ordinis,</hi> it appears chiefly in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments: That of Juriſdiction is held to be double; Firſt, Internal, where the Divine, or Holy man, by Demonſtrations, Perſwaſions, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Heavenly Counſel, and the like, ſo convinceth the inward Conſcience of a man, as it preſently reſigns, and yields obedience to that which is propoſed; as did thoſe Three Thouſand Souls,
<note place="margin">Acts 2.37, 41.</note> which were converted at the Preaching of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Secondly, External, when Chriſtians, <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> are compelled to their duty, and Obedience.</p>
            <pb n="282" facs="tcp:49655:157"/>
            <p>Now, for that firſt power of Order, and for that power of Juriſdiction Internal; our Kings never claimed, or pretended to claime, or excerciſe them, or either of them: The example of <hi>
